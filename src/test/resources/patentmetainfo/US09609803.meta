Title=Agricultural product application in overlap areas
Authors=Joel Gervais;James Henry
Owners=CNH Industrial Canada Ltd.
Abstract=By varying the agricultural product application rates when a product delivery system travels through predetermined overlap areas, the drawbacks of over seeding such overlap areas may be substantially reduced. As a result, a product delivery system may travel without stopping meter sections and without dragging a seeding tool through a completely seeded region.
