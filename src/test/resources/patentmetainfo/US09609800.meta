Abstract=An agricultural implement having agricultural implement for supporting a plurality of gangs of disk blades extending generally laterally relative to a forward travel direction. The implement has carrier frames pivotally connected to wheel assemblies for controlling the height of the carrier frames relative to the ground through hydraulic actuators acting on the wheel assemblies. The hydraulic control unit enables independent and individual control of each actuator. An electronic control unit (ECU) receives signals from a series of inclinometers where each inclinometer signal is compared to the others and the individual actuator operated to bring the actuators into in uniform synchronization.
