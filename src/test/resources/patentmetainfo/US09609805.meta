Abstract=An agricultural combine including an agricultural harvester, a crop tank for harvested material, an unloading auger for unloading and discharging crop material. The auger assembly has first and second auger tubes pivotally connected to one another. The auger tubes pivot between a first position in which the auger tubes are coaxial and a second position in which the auger tubes form one of at least two angles. A first link is pivotally connected to the first auger tube and a second link pivotally connected to the second auger tube. An actuator is connected to one of the auger tubes and to one of the links, with the first and second links being pivotally interconnected at one of two positions to maintain the auger tubes in both auger tube positions without loading the actuator.
