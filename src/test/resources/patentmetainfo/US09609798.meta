Title=Suspension device in agricultural implement
Authors=Bengt Sandberg
Owners=Vaderstad-Verken AB
Abstract=The present document shows a spring suspension device for an agricultural implement, including a casing, a beam extending through the casing, and four spring elements disposed in a space between the casing and the beam. The casing and the beam are resiliently rotatable relative to each other about a rotational axis extending along a longitudinal direction of the beam. The spring elements differ substantially from each other with respect to shape or material properties, and first and second side faces of the beam, which interact with the respective spring elements, differ substantially from each other with respect to the radius of curvature, viewed in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.
