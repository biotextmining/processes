Title=Assembly for angle adjustment
Authors=Philip Needham;Benjamin Needham
Owners=Needham Ag Technologies, LLC
Abstract=An assembly for angle adjustment may be used with agriculture equipment such as planters, applicators and tillage equipment wherein deployment of a coupler upon a shaft to allow introduction of an angle is beneficial. A closing wheel assembly incorporating the assembly for angle adjustment allows control of the angle of a closing wheel to improve soil gathering action for delivery of more or less soil to the seed slot/open furrow generated by the opener or opener assembly of a planter (drill) row unit. Exemplary applications of the assembly for angle adjustment include row unit closing wheel assemblies, fertilizer applicators and strip tillage closing systems.
