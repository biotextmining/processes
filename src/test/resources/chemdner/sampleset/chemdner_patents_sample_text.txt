US20080107693	Hybrid or chimeric polynucleotides, proteins, and compositions comprising hepatitis B virus sequences	H-2 class I negative, HLA-A2.1 transgenic HHD mice were used for a comparative evaluation of the immunogenicity of HLA-A2.1 restricted human tumor-associated CTL epitopes. A hierarchy was established among these epitopic peptides injected into mice in IFA which correlates globally with their capacity to bind and stabilize HLA-A2.1 molecules. Co-injection of a helper peptide enhanced most CTL responses. In contrast, classical HLA class I transgenic mice which still express their own class I molecules did not, in most cases, develop H.A.-A2.1-restricted CTL responses under the same experimental conditions. Different monoepitopic immunization strategies of acceptable clinical usage were compared in HHD mice. Recombinant Ty-virus-like particles, or DNA encoding epitopes fused to the hepatitis B virus middle envelope protein gave the best results. Using this latter approach and a melanoma-based polyepitope construct, CTL responses against five distinct epitopes could be elicited simultaneously in a single animal. Thus, HHD mice provide a versatile animal model for preclinical evaluation of peptide-based cancer immunotherapy.

US20100183597	Drak2 expression is associated with diabetes	Drak2 is a member of the death-associated protein family and a serine threonine kinase. In this study, we investigated its role in beta-cell survival and diabetes. Drak2 mRNA and protein were rapidly induced in islet beta-cells after stimulation by inflammatory cytokines known to be present in type 1 diabetes. Drak2 upregulation was accompanied by increased beta-cell apoptosis, beta-cell apoptosis caused by the said stimuli was inhibited by Drak2 knockdown using siRNA. Conversely, transgenic (Tg) Drak2 overexpression led to aggravated beta-cell apoptosis triggered by the stimuli. Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that Drak2 overexpressed in Tg islets is responsible for type 1 diabetes-prone phenotype. Purified Drak2 could phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 (p70S6) kinase in an in vitro kinase assay. Drak2 overexpression in NIT-1 cells led to enhanced p70S6 kinase phosphorylation, while Drak2 knockdown in these cells reduced it. These mechanistic studies proved that p70S6 kinase was a bona fide Drak2 substrate in vitro and in vivo.
