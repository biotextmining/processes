Primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibited a stellate  morphology distinct from the compact morphology of  wild-type myoblasts, and expressed c-met, a receptor  tyrosine kinase expressed in satellite cells.

The MRFs have been demonstrated to play pivotal  roles in the determination and differentiation of myogenic  precursors into mature skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Weintraub et al.,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Rudnicki and Jaenisch, 1995</xref>). Gene targeting experiments have provided much insight into understanding  MRF function in vivo. The introduction of null mutations  in all four factors into the germline of mice has revealed  the existence of a hierarchical relationship among the  MRFs and has defined two functional groups of MRFs  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Braun et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Rudnicki et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Nabeshima  et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Patapoutian et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>).  The primary MRFs, MyoD and Myf-5, appear to be required for myogenic determination, whereas the secondary MRFs, myogenin and MRF4, are required later in the  developmental program as differentiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Megeney and Rudnicki, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Rudnicki and Jaenisch, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Satellite cells, the stem cells of adult skeletal muscle, reside beneath the basal lamina of adult skeletal muscle  closely juxtaposed against muscle fibers. Satellite cells  arise around day 17 of development and are believed to  represent a unique myoblast lineage distinct from embryonic and fetal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cossu et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bischoff, 1994</xref>).  Satellite cells make up 2&#x02013;7% of the nuclei associated with  a particular fiber and the proportion varies with age and  particular muscle group. Satellite cells are normally mitotically quiescent, but are activated (i.e., initiate multiple  rounds of proliferation) in response to stress induced by  weight bearing or other trauma such as injury. The descendants of the activated satellite cells, myogenic precursor  cells, undergo multiple rounds of division prior to fusing to  existing or new fibers. Satellite cells appear to form a population of stem cells that are distinct from their daughter  myogenic precursor cells as defined by biological and  biochemical criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bischoff, 1994</xref>). The total number of  satellite cells in muscle remains relatively constant, suggesting that a capacity for self-renewal in the satellite cell  compartment maintains the population of quiescent cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bischoff, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Quiescent satellite cells express no detectable MRFs.  Upon activation and entrance into the cell cycle, MyoD is  rapidly upregulated concomitantly with proliferating cell  nuclear antigen, a marker for cell proliferation, whereas  myogenin is expressed last during the time associated with  fusion and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Smith et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Yablonka-Reuveni and Rivera, 1994</xref>). Analysis of gene expression by  RT-PCR of individual satellite cells in cultured intact muscle fibers at times after their activation substantiates that  quiescent satellite cells express no detectable MRFs but  do express <italic>c-met</italic>, a receptor tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison  and Wold, 1997</xref>). Moreover, these experiments reveal that  activated satellite cells first express either <italic>Myf-5</italic> or <italic>MyoD</italic>  followed soon after by coexpression of <italic>Myf-5</italic> and <italic>MyoD.</italic>  After proliferation, <italic>myogenin</italic> and <italic>MRF4</italic> are expressed in  cells beginning their differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison  and Wold, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The regeneration deficit observed in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; muscle  strongly supports the assertion that MyoD plays an essential role in regulating the satellite cell myogenic program  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>). Muscle regeneration is severely deficient in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice and compound mutant mice  lacking both <italic>MyoD</italic> and <italic>dystrophin</italic> (designated <italic>mdx: MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;) exhibit severe myopathy leading to premature  death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>). Muscle regeneration in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; muscle is characterized by an almost complete  absence of proliferative myogenic precursor cells. However, electron microscopic examination of <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient  muscle reveals increased numbers of satellite cells and the  number of primary myoblasts recovered is increased 2.5-fold in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; muscle and 13-fold in <italic>mdx:MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  muscle. Taken together, our data suggest a model in which  upregulation of <italic>MyoD</italic> is required for satellite cells to enter the myogenic precursor cell proliferative phase that  precedes terminal differentiation. In the absence of <italic>MyoD</italic>,  myogenic stem cells undergo an apparent increase in numbers as a consequence of an increased propensity for self-renewal rather than progression through the myogenic differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the function of <italic>MyoD</italic> during the course  of satellite cell activation, we established primary myogenic cultures from wild-type and <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient adult  muscle. Importantly, these experiments were performed  with newly established low-passage primary cultures. Our  analysis strongly supports the hypothesis that <italic>MyoD</italic> is required for satellite cells to progress efficiently through the  myogenic precursor cell developmental program. Moreover, our data suggest that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells represent an intermediate developmental stage between quiescent satellite cells and myogenic precursor cells.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of Primary Myoblasts, Cell Culture, and Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Satellite cell&#x02013;derived primary myoblasts were isolated from adult lower  hindlimb muscle from 2&#x02013;3-mo-old mice as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney  et al., 1996</xref>), with the exception that hepatocyte growth factor (10 ng/ml;  R&#x00026;D Systems Inc.) and heparin (5 ng/ml; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content>) were included in the growth medium for the first 48 h after the plating of the final  cell preparation, and supplemented with FGF2 (2.5 ng/ml FGF2) thereafter.

By contrast, wild-type cells  were highly refractile under phase-contrast microscopy  and displayed the rounded morphology and small compact  cytoplasm characteristic of primary myoblasts (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>  and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>).   </p><p>Quiescent and activated satellite cells in vivo express the  receptor tyrosine kinase c-met as do cultured myoblasts  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Allen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison and Wold, 1997</xref>). Proliferating myogenic precursor cells in vivo and myoblasts in vitro  express the intermediate filament desmin. However, satellite cells do not express desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">George-Weinstein et al.,  1993</xref>). Therefore, primary cultures were immunostained  with antibody reactive with c-met and desmin to assess  their developmental status. Virtually 100% of the primary  cells derived from both wild-type and <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals  expressed high levels of c-met as detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Fibroblast cell lines did not express  c-met (not shown). Therefore, the isolation procedure  generated highly purified cultures of myogenic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>  a). In contrast to the uniform expression of c-met, only  6.2 &#x000b1; 5.4% of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells expressed the  myoblast marker desmin, whereas 89 &#x000b1; 4.2% of wild-type  cells expressed desmin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b).

Moreover, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells displayed a 1.6-fold increase in mitotic index as determined  by BrdU incorporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b). However, this increase  in apparent growth can be partly accounted for by the reduced rate of spontaneous differentiation of mutant (0.10 &#x000b1;  0.14%) versus wild-type cells (10.0 &#x000b1; 1.4%) (see day 0,  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, a and b). In addition, interpretation of these results  is also confounded by other potential variables: differences in the proportion of cells temporarily withdrawn  from the cell-cycle, differences in rates of apoptosis, and  differences in cell-cycle kinetics. Therefore, additional  analyses are required to determine whether primary  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibit altered cell-cycle kinetics relative to primary wild-type myoblasts. </p><p>Wild-type myoblasts and <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells  both exhibited about a twofold increase in the rate of  [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation 24 h after mitogen withdrawal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a). This apparent increase in DNA synthesis  may reflect a characteristic of primary cells analogous to  the transient increase in cell proliferation observed after  the IGF-I treatment of myoblasts under culture conditions  that induce differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Engert et al., 1996</xref>). After the  first day of mitogen withdrawal, wild-type myoblasts exhibit a rapid withdrawal from the cell cycle as evidenced  by the low levels of [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a).  By contrast, the rate that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells incorporated [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine continued to increase during the 5 d  after transfer into differentiation medium. Similar results  were obtained using three independent preparations of  low passage primary myogenic cultures.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments suggested that  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells displayed continued proliferation under conditions of low mitogens that normally induce cell-cycle withdrawal and terminal differentiation of  wild-type myoblasts. To investigate cell proliferation under conditions of growth and differentiation, cultured cells  were exposed to BrdU for 4 h followed by immunodetection of nuclear localized BrdU incorporated during  DNA synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b). Wild-type primary myoblasts in  growth medium exhibited a 20% rate of BrdU incorporation, whereas <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibited a 32%  rate of labeling. After 5 d of differentiation, 93% of nuclei  in wild-type cultures expressed MHC and 5.5% were labeled by BrdU. In contrast, after 5 d of differentiation,  49% of cells in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures expressed MHC and  17% were labeled by BrdU (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b). Interestingly,  subconfluent cultures of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells in differentiation  medium exhibited up to 20% rates of BrdU incorporation,  whereas confluent cultures exhibited as low as 5% BrdU  labeling (not shown).</p><p>Considered together, these data indicate that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells continue to proliferate under low-mitogen  conditions that normally induce terminal differentiation of  wild-type myoblasts and suggest that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells exhibit contact inhibition of growth during differentiation.  The observation that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells exhibit an enhanced  proliferative potential under conditions that normally induce differentiation strongly supports the notion that  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibit an increased propensity  for self-renewal rather than progression through the differentiation program.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Muscle-specific Gene Expression</title><p>To gain further insight into the differentiation defect in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; primary cultures, total RNA was prepared  from both wild-type and <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures in growth  medium and at daily intervals after induction of differentiation. Northern blot analysis was performed using a panel  of muscle-specific probes.</p><p>The expression of the MRFs was investigated to elucidate the regulatory relationships and the potential for  functional compensation in the absence of MyoD. Northern analysis of the expression pattern of the four MRFs  confirmed that MyoD was expressed at high levels in wild-type myoblasts and was absent in the <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient  myogenic cells. Furthermore, densitometric analysis and  normalization to 18S rRNA revealed that <italic>MyoD</italic> was  somewhat downregulated during the differentiation of  wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> a). Previously, we observed a 3.5-fold increase in <italic>Myf-5</italic> mRNA in newborn and adult muscles in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Rudnicki et al., 1993</xref>). We similarly observed  a fourfold increase in <italic>Myf-5</italic> mRNA in growing <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells relative to wild-type myoblasts, supporting  the hypothesis that MyoD negatively regulates <italic>Myf-5</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> b). In wild-type cells, <italic>Myf-5</italic> mRNA levels  decreased about twofold after differentiation, whereas in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures, <italic>Myf-5</italic> mRNA levels were upregulated about twofold after mitogen withdrawal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> b). In  addition, consistent with the observed 100-fold reduction  in the rate of spontaneous differentiation, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells expressed fivefold lower levels of <italic>myogenin</italic>  mRNA in growth medium relative to wild-type myoblasts  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> c). After the induction of differentiation, the relative levels of <italic>myogenin</italic> mRNA in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells remained significantly reduced relative to wild-type cultures  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> c). In wild-type cells, the level of <italic>MRF4</italic> mRNA  remained unchanged until day 2 of differentiation and  was thereafter upregulated about sevenfold. By contrast,  <italic>MRF4</italic> mRNA was upregulated in differentiating <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  cultures to levels approximately two- to threefold lower  than that of wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> d).</p><p>Western analysis of MRF expression in lysates of primary cultures in growth medium confirmed the absence of  MyoD protein in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> e). Interestingly,  Myf-5 protein was upregulated &#x0003e;10-fold in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  cells, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may  contribute to this increase (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, b and e for comparison). As suggested by the Northern analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> c),  myogenin protein was absent in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells in growth  medium, whereas low levels were detected in wild-type  myoblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> e).</p><p>To assess the differentiation kinetics at the level of gene  expression, Northern analysis was performed with a panel  of muscle-specific markers. Analysis of mRNA levels for  differentiation-specific markers revealed a pattern consistent with overall delayed kinetics of differentiation in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells. For example, low levels of  &#x003b1;-skeletal and &#x003b1;-cardiac actin mRNAs were detected in  wild-type cells in growth medium and these increased rapidly after mitogen withdrawal. By contrast, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  cells in growth medium expressed no detectable sarcomeric actin mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, a and b). After induction of  differentiation &#x003b1;-skeletal actin mRNA increased about  threefold in wild-type cells, whereas in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells the  levels increased &#x0223c;65% of wild-type levels by day 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  a). Although lower than that of &#x003b1;-skeletal actin, the levels  of &#x003b1;-cardiac actin were found to increase in a similar pattern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b). Cultured <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells displayed a twofold reduction in levels of acetylcholine receptor &#x003b4; subunit (AchR &#x003b4;) mRNA in growth medium.  After the induction of differentiation, a 5-fold increase  was observed in wild-type cultures compared to an &#x0223c;2-fold increase in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> c) for a net 10-fold  relative difference. </p><p>The protein coding for M-cadherin, a muscle-specific  adhesion molecule, has been suggested to be expressed in  quiescent satellite cells as well as to play an important role  during myoblast differentiation and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Irintchev et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Pouliot et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Zeschnigk et al., 1995</xref>). However, RT-PCR analysis only detects <italic>M-cadherin</italic> expression in a small number of quiescent satellite cells suggesting that M-cadherin may not be useful as a marker for  satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison and Wold, 1997</xref>). In wild-type  cells, <italic>M-cadherin</italic> mRNA was detected at low levels in  growth medium, <italic>M-cadherin</italic> increased fivefold by day 2 of  differentiation, and was subsequently downregulated (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> d). By contrast, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells in growth medium expressed no detectable <italic>M-cadherin</italic> mRNA. However, low levels were detectable after mitogen withdrawal.  Immunohistochemical detection of M-cadherin on cells in  growth medium confirmed the reduced level of protein detectable on <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells relative to wild-type myoblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> d). The reduced levels of <italic>M-cadherin</italic> expression observed in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells may account in  part for the differentiation deficiency as M-cadherin appears to be required for efficient myogenic differentiation  and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Zeschnigk et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The receptor tyrosine kinase Musk has been suggested  to be expressed in activated satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">DeChiara et al.,  1996</xref>), and therefore may provide an additonal marker for  early myogenic cells. Northern blot analysis with a <italic>Musk</italic>-specific probe revealed the expression of three distinct  isoforms in differentiating myogenic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> a). In  wild-type cultures in growth medium, the large mRNA  (isoform 1) was not expressed, the midsize mRNA (isoform 2) was expressed at intermediate levels, and the small  mRNA (isoform 3) was expressed at higher levels. Induction of differentiation of wild-type cultures resulted in upregulation of isoforms 1 and 2, but little change in isoform  3. By contrast, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells in growth medium expressed no detectable expression of <italic>Musk</italic> mRNA  isoforms 1 and 2, and low levels of isoform 3. After induction of differentiation of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures, delayed upregulation of isoforms 1 and 2 was observed. Therefore,  these data suggest that <italic>Musk</italic> is upregulated in a differentiation-dependent manner during muscle regeneration. </p><p>Adhalin, a dystrophin-associated protein also known as  &#x003b1;-sarcoglycan, is upregulated during myoblast differentiation and is required for fully functional myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Roberds et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). Human loss-of-function  mutations in adhalin results in limb girdle childhood autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (SCARMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Roberds et al., 1994</xref>). The delayed differentiation in the limb  girdles evident in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kablar et al., 1997</xref>)  raised the possibility that adhalin may represent a <italic>MyoD</italic>  target gene. Northern analysis revealed that adhalin is  completely absent in growing <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> f).  At the onset of differentiation, <italic>adhalin</italic> was slightly downregulated in wild-type cells, whereas it steadily increased  in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures reaching &#x0223c;50% of wild-type levels  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> b). Therefore, these data substantiate the delayed  differentiation of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myocytes, but do not elucidate whether adhalin is specifically upregulated in the  <italic>MyoD</italic>-induced embryonic lineage that gives rise to hypaxial musculature.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of Growth-associated Gene Products</title><p>To investigate the continued proliferation of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  cells in differentiation medium, we examined the mRNA  expression levels of several growth-associated proteins  that have been demonstrated to play important roles in  the control of myoblast differentiation. The plakoglobin-related protein, &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Butz et al., 1992</xref>), is believed to  play important roles in cellular growth and morphogenesis  in response to cellular adhesion and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Miller  and Moon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barth et al., 1997</xref>). Primary wild-type  myoblasts expressed abundant <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>catenin</italic> mRNA under  growth conditions. These levels increased threefold after  2 d of differentiation but subsequently decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>  a). In <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-<italic>catenin</italic> mRNA levels were  found to continuously increase and to stabilize at levels  that were comparable to that of wild-type cells by day 5 of  differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> a). Detection of &#x003b2;-catenin protein  by immunofluorescence revealed a similar nuclear cytoplasmic distribution in wild-type and mutant myogenic  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> c). Therefore, these data do not support a role  for &#x003b2;-catenin in the differentiation deficiency evident in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells.</p><p>The PEA3 gene product is upregulated in activated satellite cells in vivo, and has been suggested to be important  for myoblast fusion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). Wild-type  primary myoblasts in growth medium expressed very low  levels of <italic>PEA3</italic> mRNA. However <italic>PEA3</italic> levels increased  about twofold by day 5 of differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> b). By  contrast, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells in growth medium displayed  sixfold higher levels of <italic>PEA3</italic> mRNA, which declined  steadily to wild-type levels by day 4 of differentiation (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> b). However, this increased level of <italic>PEA3</italic> was not associated with enhanced differentiation (see above). Nevertheless, because PEA3 is expressed in activated satellite  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>), these data are consistent with  the notion that primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells represent an intermediate stage between a satellite cell and a  myogenic precursor cell.</p><p>The p53-inducible cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21/ WAF1 arrests proliferating cells when ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">el-Deiry et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Harper et al., 1993</xref>) and is  upregulated by MyoD during the differentiation of C2C12  myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Guo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Halevy et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover,  forced overexpression of p21 in myoblasts drives induction  of differentiation-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Skapek et al., 1995</xref>). Unexpectedly, we observed no significant differences in <italic>p21</italic>  mRNA levels between wild-type and <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, in  growth medium or during differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> c). Therefore, the normal induction of <italic>p21</italic> in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic  cells after mitogen withdrawal suggests that <italic>p21</italic> induction  is not MyoD-dependent and that p21 requires MyoD to  positively stimulate differentiation.</p><p>The insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I, stimulates the  proliferation and inhibits differentiation of cultured myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Quinn and Roh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ewton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Engert et al.,  1996</xref>). To assess whether IGF-I expression was altered in  the absence of MyoD, we analyzed expression levels in  primary myogenic cultures. Wild-type myoblasts in growth  conditions expressed low levels of <italic>IGF-I</italic> mRNA and these  levels were rapidly extinguished after mitogen withdrawal  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> d). By contrast, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells expressed over threefold higher levels of the small <italic>IGF-I</italic>  mRNA isoforms 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Yamori et al., 1991</xref>) and these  remained constant after transfer of the cells to differentiation medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> d). Interestingly, the 7-kb pre-<italic>IGF-I</italic>  mRNA (isoform 3) was not expressed under growth conditions but was rapidly upregulated after 3 d of differentiation. These observations strongly suggest that MyoD negatively regulates IGF-I expression and raises the possibility  that MyoD is required for the repression of IGF-I expression during normal myogenic differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>The MyoD Mutant Cellular Phenotype Is a Cell  Autonomous Deficit</title><p>The reduced fusion and continued proliferation of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells under conditions that normally promote  cell-cycle withdrawal and terminal differentiation can be  hypothesized to be a consequence of cell autonomous attributes. For example, the marked reduction in M-cadherin expression (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> d and 6 b) and the overexpression  of IGF-I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> d) in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells could both  act to inhibit differentiation. Alternatively, <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells  may have a unique developmental identity that precludes  participation in the myogenic precursor cell differentiation  program. To explore these possibilities, we mixed different proportions of wild-type myoblasts with lacZ-expressing <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells, and induced differentiation  by culturing the cells in 5% horse serum for 5 d (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).  Importantly, PGK-lacZ expression is unaffected by terminal differentiation in transfected wild-type myoblasts (not  shown). Strikingly, lacZ-labeled nuclei were never detected within any myotubes containing more than two  nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, b and c). Conversely, the differentiation  of wild-type myocytes was completely unaffected by the  presence of high numbers of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells  (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, b and c, with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> d). Taken together,  these data support the notion that Myf-5 expression may  define a distinct cell identity in the satellite cell developmental program. </p><p>Our analysis suggested that in satellite cell&#x02013;derived  myogenic cell lineage, important aspects of cytomorphology, differentiation, and ultimately fusion of mononuclear  cells into myotubes are highly dependent on MyoD activity and cannot be substituted for by other MRFs. To determine whether the observed phenotypic differences between <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; and wild-type primary myogenic cells  were attributable to MyoD, a <italic>MyoD</italic>-expression plasmid  was introduced into low passage cells and stable pools of  transfectants were analyzed. Western blot analysis indicated that transfected <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (termed <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic>)  expressed the exogenous MyoD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> a). By densitometry, the levels were found to be approximately  threefold lower than in wild-type cells but similar to  MyoD levels in C2C12 myoblasts. As expected, untransfected or PGK-Puro transfected <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells did not  express MyoD protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> a). In growth medium, pools  of stable <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic> cells displayed an almost complete reversion of the fibroblastlike phenotype and exhibited a  rounded compact cytomorphology similar to wild-type  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> b). Transfer of <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic> cultures into differentiation medium resulted in increased numbers of MF20-positive differentiated myocytes that displayed the elongated bipolar multinucleated myotube morphology typical  of wild-type myocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> b). After 3 d in low serum  medium, the <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic> pools displayed fusion indices that  were comparable to wild-type cultures and approximately  fivefold higher than <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> c). Differentiated <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic> myocytes contained 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.4 nuclei on average, differentiated wild-type myocytes contained 2.7 &#x000b1; 0.1  nuclei on average, and differentiated <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myocytes  contained only single nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> c). Lastly, transfection  of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells with a <italic>Myf-5</italic> expression plasmid did  not rescue cytomorphology or differentiation potential  (not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest  that expression of MyoD is necessary and sufficient to reestablish the progression of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells  through the differentiation program.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Analysis of muscle regeneration in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice led to  the suggestion that MyoD is required for satellite cells to  efficiently give rise to proliferative myogenic precursor  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>). To characterize the phenotype of <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient myoblasts and to gain insight into  the role of <italic>MyoD</italic> in the activation and differentiation of  satellite cells, an in-depth characterization of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  primary myoblast cultures was undertaken. The establishment and propagation of stable cell lines can potentially  result in aneuploidy as well as the introduction of additional mutations, which are necessary for immortalization  and continuous proliferation in culture. To avoid such  anomalies, all of our analyses were carried out using newly  established low-passage primary myoblast cultures. Our  characterization of early passage primary cultures reported here differs from the analysis of later passage  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures (&#x0003e;15 doublings) that exhibited decreased growth, readily formed multinucleated myotubes,  and grew in an FGF2-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al.,  1996</xref>; data not shown). Therefore, these results underscore  the importance of characterizing early passage (&#x0003c;10 doublings) primary cultures before any adaptation to growth  in tissue culture conditions.</p><p>Primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibited a fibroblastlike cytomorphology, and expressed <italic>c-met</italic> and high  levels of <italic>PEA3</italic> and <italic>IGF-I</italic>, but did not express desmin,  <italic>M-cadherin</italic>, or <italic>Musk.</italic> Transfer of primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells  into differentiation medium resulted in formation of reduced numbers of mononuclear myocytes and delayed induction of differentiation-specific markers. Mixing experiments revealed that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells did not influence the  differentiation of wild-type myocytes and did not fuse with  differentiating myotubes. Forced expression of <italic>MyoD</italic> rescued both the cytomorphology and the differentiation  deficit. Taken together, these data suggest that <italic>Myf-5</italic>  expressing cells represent an intermediate between a quiescent satellite cell and a proliferating myogenic precursor  cell.</p><p>Northern blot analysis revealed that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells expressed fourfold higher levels of <italic>Myf-5</italic> mRNA  and Western analysis revealed an even greater increase in  Myf-5 protein. Similar findings are observed for the in vivo  expression of <italic>Myf-5</italic> in the muscle of <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient mice  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Rudnicki et al., 1992</xref>). Interestingly, delayed muscle differentiation has also been reported during limb development of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; embryos in which Myf-5 expressing  myogenic processors arrive in the limb but differentiate  with markedly delayed kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kablar et al., 1997</xref>). Embryos lacking <italic>MyoD</italic> display normal development of trunk  musculature in the body proper, whereas muscle development in limb buds and branchial arches is delayed by  &#x0223c;2.5 d. In contrast, embryos lacking <italic>Myf-5</italic> display normal  muscle development in limb buds and branchial arches,  but exhibit a marked delay in development of trunk muscles. Although <italic>MyoD</italic>-mutant embryos exhibit delayed  development of limb musculature, the migration of Pax-3&#x02013;expressing cells into the limb buds and subsequent induction of Myf-5 in myogenic precursors occurs normally.  These data, together with the observed regeneration deficit in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; muscle, indicate that <italic>MyoD</italic> and <italic>Myf-5</italic>  cannot fully substitute for each other during embryogenesis and in satellite cells, and suggest that <italic>Myf-5</italic> and <italic>MyoD</italic>  activate discrete subsets of target genes that differentially  define myogenic cell identity.</p><p>Forced expression of <italic>MyoD</italic> in a variety of cell lines induces growth arrest even in the absence of differentiation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Olson, 1992</xref>). Consistent with this, myogenic cells lacking  <italic>MyoD</italic> displayed inefficient withdrawal from the cell cycle  in response to low mitogens. However, the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 was upregulated to similar levels in wild-type  and <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells in growth medium and following induction of differentiation. In C2C12 myoblasts, expression  of p21 appears to be directly induced by MyoD upon cell-cycle arrest and terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Guo et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Halevy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Skapek et al., 1995</xref>). Moreover, forced  expression of p21 arrests proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">el-Deiry et al.,  1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Harper et al., 1993</xref>), and induces the terminal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Skapek et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between cell-cycle control and differentiation appears to be uncoupled in primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells. Interestingly, depending on context, p21  expression can either arrest cells via inhibiting cdk activity,  or promote cell division by acting as a cdk4/cyclin D1 assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">LaBaer et al., 1997</xref>). Future characterization of cell cycle control in mutant cells should elucidate  this aspect of the <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cell phenotype.</p><p>The <italic>PEA3</italic> transcription factor was observed to be expressed at about sixfold higher levels in <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient  myoblasts under growth conditions. The ETS-domain  transcription factor PEA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Xin et al., 1992</xref>) is rapidly induced after muscle damage and forced expression of PEA3  stimulates myogenesis in vitro when overexpressed in  satellite cell&#x02013;derived cultured myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Peterson and  Houle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). These data led to the suggestion that PEA3 is an important regulator of activated  satellite cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Taylor et al., 1997</xref>). The lack of correlation between increased expression of <italic>PEA3</italic> and differentiation potential in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells supports  the assertion that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells have an identity distinct from wild-type myoblasts. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>PEA3</italic> is correlated with increased metastatic potential of mammary adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Trimble  et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of PEA3 in cultured cells directly induces the upregulation of a subset of  matrix metalloproteases (Hassell, J.A., personal communication). After muscle damage, activated satellite cells  readily cross the basal lamina and are capable of migrating  from surviving to damaged areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hughes and Blau, 1990</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Phillips et al., 1990</xref>). By contrast, cultured primary myoblasts injected into muscle exhibit a very poor ability to  migrate away from the injection site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Fan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gussoni et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells are more invasive than  their wild-type counterpart.</p><p>M-cadherin had been suggested to be expressed in satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Irintchev et al., 1994</xref>). However, recent RT-PCR  analysis indicates that a small minority of satellite cells express <italic>M-cadherin</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison and Wold, 1997</xref>).  Consistent with this we observed markedly reduced expression of M-cadherin in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells relative to wild-type cells (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> d and 5 b). This observation raises the possibility that <italic>MyoD</italic> directly or indirectly  regulates the expression of surface adhesion molecules  involved in fusion and differentiation. Interestingly, incubation of antagonistic M-cadherin peptides or antisense  RNA inhibits both myoblast fusion and cell-cycle withdrawal in conditions that normally promote differentiation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Zeschnigk et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, these data suggest that  cell-cycle withdrawal during terminal differentiation also  involves cell&#x02013;cell interactions.</p><p>Cellular adhesion is clearly linked to regulation of proliferation, migration, and differentiation. For example,  expression of dominant negative cadherin inhibits proliferation and stimulates terminal differentiation of human  epidermal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Zhu and Watt, 1996</xref>). Moreover,  integrin and cadherin synergistically inhibit migration and  promote the aggregation of myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Huttenlocher et al.,  1998</xref>). Forced overexpression of an effector of adhesion  mediated signaling integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in intestinal epithelial cells and mammary epithelial cells induces  the activity of G1/S cyclin/Cdks, downregulates E-cadherin expression, induces nuclear translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin, and results in increased invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Radeva et al.,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Novak et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, examination of integrin and cadherin function in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells  should elucidate the role of adhesion in the control of proliferation and migration in early myogenic precursors.</p><p>High level expression of IGF-I in L6 myoblasts stimulates proliferation and inhibits differentiation, whereas  lower levels of IGF-I stimulate both proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Quinn and Roh, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ewton et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lefaucheur and Sebille, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Engert et al., 1996</xref>). A striking feature of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells was the relatively high expression of <italic>IGF-I</italic> mRNA and its continued upregulation  during differentiation. In contrast, wild-type myoblasts expressed lower levels of <italic>IGF-I</italic> in growth conditions and  these levels decreased during differentiation. It is interesting to speculate that increased <italic>IGF-I</italic> expression in  <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cultures contributes to the observed differentiation delay. As <italic>IGF-I</italic> levels rapidly decrease in wild-type  cultures induced to differentiate, an interesting hypothesis  is that MyoD is required to downregulate <italic>IGF-I</italic> at the onset of differentiation. In <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells, continued <italic>IGF-I</italic> expression could result in an autocrine loop  that acts to promote proliferation. However, the presence  of <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells did not inhibit the differentiation of wild-type primary myoblasts raising the possibility  that expression of other components of the IGF-I signaling pathway are downregulated in wild-type myoblasts.  These data further underscore the assertion that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells are distinct from wild-type myoblasts.</p><p>Continuous myoblast cell lines lacking <italic>MyoD</italic> exhibit  somewhat similar traits in comparison to primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells. For example, C2C12 cells expressing antisense <italic>MyoD</italic> RNA, display increased <italic>Myf-5</italic> expression,  decreased <italic>IGF-II</italic> expression, and are defective in differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Montarras et al., 1996</xref>). The brain tumor&#x02013;derived  BC3H1 myoblast cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Taubman et al., 1989</xref>) expresses  Myf-5 but does not express MyoD, and exhibits a differentiation deficit with reduced ability to form multinucleated  myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brennan et al., 1990</xref>). However, unlike primary  <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient myogenic cells, BC3H1 myocytes in differentiation-inducing medium exhibit normal upregulation of myogenin together with normal induction of subsets of MHC isoforms and other differentiation-specific  markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Taubman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Miller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brennan et al.,  1990</xref>). Forced expression of <italic>myogenin</italic> in BC3H1 cells is  unable to rescue the differentiation deficit, whereas forced  expression of <italic>MyoD</italic> confers competency for myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brennan et al., 1990</xref>). Forced expression of a  functional MyoD protein in <italic>MyoD</italic>-deficient cells was sufficient to revert the <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cytomorphology and rescue the differentiation defect as evidenced by a dramatic  increase in fusion index of <italic>MyoD&#x0002b;</italic> cells. Therefore, these  data support the assertion that lack of <italic>MyoD</italic> results in a  cell-autonomous deficit in the satellite cell differentiation  program. Taken together, the parallels observed between  primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myocytes and continuous myoblast  cell lines deficient in <italic>MyoD</italic> support a unique set of functions for <italic>MyoD</italic> that cannot be substituted for by <italic>Myf-5.</italic></p><p>The muscle regeneration deficit in <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; muscle  suggests that expression of <italic>MyoD</italic> is required for satellite  cells to efficiently form differentiation-competent myogenic precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Megeney et al., 1996</xref>). RT-PCR  analysis reveals that activated satellite cells first express either <italic>Myf-5</italic> alone or <italic>MyoD</italic> alone, before coexpressing  <italic>Myf-5</italic> and <italic>MyoD</italic>, and subsequently progressing through  the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cornelison and Wold, 1997</xref>). Our  analysis of the phenotype of primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic  cells can be interpreted to suggest that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells represent an intermediate stage between a quiescent satellite cell and a myogenic precursor cell. Together, these data suggest the hypothesis that expression  of <italic>Myf-5</italic> alone may define an intermediate developmental  stage that provides a mechanism for satellite cell self-renewal. In this model, activated satellite cells expressing  only <italic>Myf-5</italic> could undergo cell division and either return to  quiescence by downregulating <italic>Myf-5</italic>, or alternatively upregulating <italic>MyoD</italic> and progressing through the myogenic  program (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Clearly, further analysis of the developmental potential and phenotype of primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212;  myogenic cells may present a unique opportunity to investigate the early myogenic program of satellite cells. </p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Primary <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells exhibit a premyoblastic cellular phenotype.

Taken together, we interpret these data  to suggest that <italic>MyoD</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; myogenic cells represent an intermediate stage between myogenic stem cell and a myogenic precursor  cell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9807094.f9"/></fig></sec><ack><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of  Health and the Muscular Dystrophy Association to M.A. Rudnicki.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations used in this paper</title><def-list><def-item><term>BrdU</term><def><p>5-bromo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MHC</term><def><p>myosin heavy chain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRF</term><def><p>myogenic regulatory factors</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheehan</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kendall</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name><name><surname>Rice</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hepatocyte growth factor activates quiescent skeletal muscle satellite cells in vitro</article-title><source>J Cell Physiol</source><year>1995</year><volume>165</volume><fpage>307</fpage><lpage>312</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7593208</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Masaki</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischman</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Immunochemical analysis of myosin heavy chain during avian myogenesis in vivo and in vitro</article-title><source>J Cell Biol</source><year>1982</year><volume>95</volume><fpage>763</fpage><lpage>770</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6185504</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barth</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathke</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cadherins, catenins and APC protein: interplay between cytoskeletal complexes and signaling pathways</article-title><source>Curr Opin Cell Biol</source><year>1997</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>683</fpage><lpage>690</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9330872</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Birnboim</surname><given-names>HC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Rapid extraction of high molecular weight RNA from cultured cells and granulocytes for Northern analysis</article-title><source>Nucleic Acids Res</source><year>1988</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>1487</fpage><lpage>1497</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2450333</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="other">Bischoff, R. 1994.
