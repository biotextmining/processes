However, cooperative interactions between subunits also affect the voltage dependence of channel opening, and these interactions can be altered by  making substitutions at uncharged residues in the S4 region. We have studied the activation of two mutant <italic>Shaker</italic>  channels that have different S4 amino acid sequences, ILT (V369I, I372L, and S376T) and Shaw S4 (the S4 of  <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaw substituted into <italic>Shaker</italic>), and yet have very similar ionic current properties. Both mutations affect  cooperativity, making a cooperative transition in the activation pathway rate limiting and shifting it to very positive  voltages, but analysis of gating and ionic current recordings reveals that the ILT and Shaw S4 mutant channels  have different activation pathways. Analysis of gating currents suggests that the dominant effect of the ILT mutation is to make the final cooperative transition to the open state of the channel rate limiting in an activation pathway that otherwise resembles that of <italic>Shaker</italic>. The charge movement associated with the final gating transition in  ILT activation can be measured as an isolated component of charge movement in the voltage range of channel  opening and accounts for 13% (&#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub>) of the total charge moved in the ILT activation pathway. The remainder  of the ILT gating charge (87%) moves at negative voltages, where channels do not open, and confirms the presence of <italic>Shaker</italic>-like conformational changes between closed states in the activation pathway. In contrast to ILT, the  activation pathway of Shaw S4 seems to involve a single cooperative charge-moving step between a closed and an  open state. We cannot detect any voltage-dependent transitions between closed states for Shaw S4. Restoring basic  residues that are missing in Shaw S4 (R1, R2, and K7) rescues charge movement between closed states in the activation pathway, but does not alter the voltage dependence of the rate-limiting transition in activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>patch clamp</kwd><kwd><italic>Shaker</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Introduction"><title>introduction</title><p>Voltage-dependent ion channels respond to changes in  the electric field across the cell membrane by undergoing conformational changes that open and close an  ion-permeable pore. The voltage dependence of channel opening, or activation, is caused by rearrangement  of charges within the channel protein associated with  conformational changes, thereby making the rates of  the conformational changes voltage dependent. The  movement of charge within the channel can be detected as gating current (Schneider and Chandler;  1973; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Keynes and  Rojas, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">St&#x000fc;hmer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bezanilla et al., 1991</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Perozo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Sigg et  al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sigworth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Stefani et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Zagotta et  al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Sigg and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998a</xref>&#x02013;c).</p><p>Understanding the molecular mechanism of voltage-dependent gating is an important goal of ion channel  biophysics. Voltage-dependent potassium channels are  particularly attractive for structure&#x02013;function studies because members of this family share considerable sequence similarity, but exhibit a wide range of gating behaviors. Also, functional voltage-dependent potassium  channels can be expressed as homotetramers, and the  symmetry of a homotetrameric protein is likely to be reflected in the gating process. Studies on <italic>Shaker</italic>, a voltage-dependent potassium channel cloned from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have yielded many important insights into processes of activation. However, the ability to study the  gating process in wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> is limited by the fact  that it is difficult to study individual transitions independently of one another because the rates and voltage  dependences of most of the transitions in <italic>Shaker</italic> activation are too similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al., 1994b</xref>). The ability  to perturb the energies of gating transitions with site- directed mutations provides a means to dissect out  steps in the gating pathway for study using electrophysiological methods.</p><p>The fourth transmembrane segment (S4) of voltage-gated cation channels has been proposed to function  as a voltage sensor because of its high charge density  and the fact that it has been highly conserved among  voltage-gated cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Noda et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Catterall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Durrell and Guy, 1992</xref>). The sequence of  the S4 is unusual, consisting of repeating basic residues  at every third position, separated by neutral or hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Noda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Salkoff et al., 1987</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Tanabe et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Papazian et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Tempel  et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Baumann et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Ellis et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kayano et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>The results of several different lines of experimentation provide strong evidence for a role of the S4 in  sensing voltage. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has  been shown that mutations that neutralize S4 charged  residues can decrease the amount of charge moved per  channel during activation of <italic>Shaker</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aggarwal and  MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>) and can decrease  the voltage sensitivity of channel opening in voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">St&#x000fc;hmer et al.,  1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Papazian et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Liman et al., 1991</xref>). Further, studies on skeletal muscle sodium channels and  <italic>Shaker</italic> potassium channels have demonstrated that the  S4 region &#x0201c;moves&#x0201d; during activation by showing that  the accessibility of some S4 residues to externally and  internally applied chemical modifying reagents can be  manipulated by holding the channel in open or closed  conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Yang and Horn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Yang et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yusaf et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Baker et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>However, the results of recent experiments suggest  that the S4 is not only involved in sensing voltage during activation, but also in mediating cooperative interactions between channel subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al.,  1998a</xref>,b). Substitution of the S4 segment from the  <italic>Drosophila</italic> channel <italic>Shaw</italic> into <italic>Shaker</italic> causes a dramatic  decrease in the voltage dependence of channel opening and makes the time course of activation slow and  single exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>). The  slow, single-exponential gating kinetics suggest that the  Shaw S4 mutation alters activation gating by slowing a  cooperative transition in the activation pathway sufficiently to make it rate limiting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al.  (1998a)</xref> also found that the gating of heterodimers  with wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> and chimeric Shaw S4 subunits  can be predicted from properties of the homotetrameric channels only if it is assumed that the mutations alter cooperative transitions in the activation  pathway rather than independent transitions.</p><p>Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref> found that the  kinetic and voltage-dependent properties of the Shaw  S4 ionic currents can be reproduced by introducing a  subset of the substitutions present in the chimera into  <italic>Shaker</italic>: V369I, I372L, S376T, to make the ILT mutant.  The gating behavior of the ILT and Shaw S4 mutants  can be accounted for by making the final cooperative  transition rate limiting in a kinetic model of <italic>Shaker</italic> activation, without changing the rates or voltage dependences of any other transitions in the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>,b).</p><p>Cooperativity between subunits is a recurrent feature  in the various kinetic models of potassium channel gating, but it can be implemented in any of a number of  ways, including: a sequential mechanism in which the  movement of each voltage sensor facilitates the movement of the next one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Tytgat and Hess, 1992</xref>), a cooperative stabilization of the open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al.,  1994b</xref>), and the presence of one or more highly cooperative or concerted transitions in the activation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sigworth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bezanilla et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>). At present, little  is known about the underlying conformational changes  that produce the cooperativity that is observed in the  activation of potassium channels.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate activation of the Shaw S4  chimera and ILT mutant at the level of gating currents  to learn more about the role of the S4 in cooperativity  and voltage sensing in the process of activation. Gating  current recordings allow us to observe directly the  charge movement associated with the voltage-dependent conformational changes that the channel undergoes in the activation pathway. Thus, gating current recordings from Shaw S4 and ILT channels can provide  valuable insights into the nature of the cooperative  conformational change and its position in the activation pathway and can reveal effects of the mutations on  other transitions in the activation pathway that may be  masked at the level of ionic currents by the presence of  a rate-limiting transition.</p></sec><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>materials and methods</title><sec><title>Molecular Biology and Terminology</title><p>All experiments were performed on a mutant form of <italic>ShB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Papazian et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Kamb et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pongs et al., 1988</xref>), designated ShB&#x00394;6&#x02013;46, in which fast N-type inactivation was removed  by deletion of amino acids 6&#x02013;46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>). This allowed  us to study activation in isolation from the fast (N-type) inactivation process. ShB&#x00394;6&#x02013;46 still undergoes a relatively slow inactivation process (C-type inactivation), but the time constant for  C-type inactivation (&#x0223c;1.5 s) is sufficiently slow that it does not interfere with measurement of activation parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hoshi et al.,  1991</xref>). ShB&#x00394;6-46 cDNA was further modified by the introduction  of a unique &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; StuI restriction enzyme site 3&#x02032; to the S4 coding region, at amino acid positions 380&#x02013;382. This modification,  which does not alter the amino acid sequence, was made using  the polymerase chain reaction method to generate a cassette that  was inserted between two naturally occurring unique restriction  enzyme sites within the <italic>Shaker</italic> cDNA, StyI and NsiI. In this paper,  the term &#x0201c;<italic>Shaker</italic>&#x0201d; will always refer to the ShB&#x00394;6&#x02013;46 construct.</p><p>The Shaw S4 chimera and ILT mutant were constructed as described in Smith-Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1998a</xref>,b). The Shaw S4:RRK mutant substitutes eight hydrophobic residues from the S4 of Shaw  into <italic>Shaker</italic> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The Shaw S4:RRK mutation was made by  annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides spanning the  unique StyI and the silent StuI restriction enzyme sites in <italic>Shaker</italic>,  and ligating the annealed oligos into <italic>Shaker</italic> digested with StyI  and StuI restriction enzymes. The sequence of Shaw S4:RRK was  verified by dideoxy termination sequencing. </p><p>For gating current experiments, expression levels were increased for ILT, Shaw S4, and Shaw S4:RRK constructs by subcloning into a high-expression <italic>Shaker</italic> vector obtained from Ligia  Toro. The high-expression <italic>Shaker</italic> construct contained a pore  mutation that has been reported to render the pore nonconducting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; but see <sc>discussion</sc>). The high-expression vector was used as a background to make high-expression  conducting and nonconducting versions of ILT, Shaw S4, and  Shaw S4:RRK. To generate the conducting versions of ILT and  Shaw S4, DNA from the S4 mutant constructs was cut with BsiWI  and SpeI restriction enzymes, generating a fragment that includes the mutant S4 and the wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> pore. These DNA  fragments were substituted for the corresponding BsiWI to SpeI  fragment in the high-expression W434F <italic>Shaker</italic> construct. To generate nonconducting versions of ILT, Shaw S4, and Shaw S4: RRK, DNA from the S4 mutant constructs was cut with the BsiWI  and NsiI restriction enzymes to generate a fragment that includes the mutant S4 region, but not the pore region of the  channel. These DNA fragments were substituted for the corresponding BsiWI-NsiI fragment in the high-expression W434F  <italic>Shaker</italic> construct.</p><p>To distinguish between constructs that contain a wild-type  pore sequence and the pore sequence with the W434F mutation,  we refer to the channels as &#x0201c;conducting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;nonconducting,&#x0201d;  respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression System</title><p>All channels were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes by injection of  G(5&#x02032;)ppp(5&#x02032;)G capped mRNA from the different channel constructs. mRNA was transcribed in vitro from linearized plasmid  containing channel DNA constructs as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Zagotta et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>). For the original DNA constructs of <italic>Shaker</italic> and the S4 mutants, mRNA was transcribed with  T7 RNA polymerase from a KpnI-linearized DNA template. For  the high-expression conducting versions of ILT and Shaw S4 and  for the nonconducting (W434F) version of ILT, Shaw S4, and  Shaw S4:RRK, mRNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase  from an EcoRI-linearized DNA template. Recordings of macroscopic ionic currents typically were carried out 1&#x02013;10 d after injection, whereas gating current recordings typically were carried out  14&#x02013;28 d after injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All experiments were carried out at 20 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C.</p><sec><title>Macroscopic ionic currents.</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings of macroscopic ionic currents were carried out from excised membrane  patches in the inside-out configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>). The  ionic current data for <italic>Shaker</italic>, Shaw S4, and ILT presented in Figs.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> were taken from Smith-Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1998a</xref>,b). For all  other ionic current recordings presented in this paper, currents  were recorded with an Axopatch 1B (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="axon">Axon Instruments</named-content>) patch  clamp amplifier and low-pass filtered using an eight-pole Bessel  filter (Frequency Devices, Inc.). The standard extracellular (pipette) solution used for these experiments contained (mM): 140  NaCl, 2 KCl, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES (NaOH), pH 7.1. The standard  intracellular solution (bath) contained (mM): 140 KCl, 11  EGTA, 10 HEPES (<italic>N</italic>-methylglucamine), pH 7.2. Ionic currents  were digitized at 50&#x02013;200 &#x003bc;s/point, depending on the channel kinetics. All data were filtered at 9 kHz unless otherwise stated. Details are stated in the figure legends. A Macintosh-based system  with hardware interface from <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="instrutech">Instrutech Corp</named-content>. and software from  HEKA Electronik was used to generate pulses and digitize and  store data. Patch pipettes were constructed from VWR borosilicate glass and had initial resistances of 0.4&#x02013;0.8 M&#x003a9;. No series resistance compensation was used; however, the error due to uncompensated series resistance for this series of experiments was  typically &#x0003c;2 mV (except for the gating current experiments on  conducting channels in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; see the legend of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and text  for details). Linear leak and capacitative currents were subtracted with a P/4 protocol from a holding potential of &#x02212;110  mV. A holding potential of &#x02212;80 mV, followed by a 1-s prepulse to  &#x02212;100 mV was used before the test pulses.      </p></sec><sec><title>Gating currents.</title><p>Gating currents were measured either with a  high performance cut-open oocyte voltage clamp (CA-1; Dagan  Corp.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Tagliatela et al., 1992</xref>) or with inside-out patches. The  two different experimental procedures will be described separately.</p><p>In the cut-open oocyte clamp configuration, the oocytes were  permeabilized by addition to the lower chamber of internal solution containing 0.3% saponin. Agar bridges with platinum iridium wire were filled with 1 M sodium methanesulfonic acid  (NaMES). Microelectrodes were filled with 3 M KCl and had tip  resistances of &#x0003c;1 M&#x003a9;. No series resistance compensation was  used. Gating currents were digitized at 24 &#x003bc;s/point and filtered  at 10 kHz. The internal recording solution included (mM): 110  KOH, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.1  with MES. The external recording solution included (mM): 110  NaOH, 2 KOH, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with MES.  Because <italic>Shaker</italic>, ILT, and Shaw S4:RRK gating currents activate in  different voltage ranges, voltage and leak subtraction protocols  had to be customized for each channel. For <italic>Shaker</italic>, ohmic capacitive and linear leak currents were substracted using either a &#x0002b;P/ 10 protocol from a holding voltage of &#x0002b;20 mV or a &#x02212;P/5 protocol from a holding voltage of &#x02212;120 mV. The leak-subtracted gating current records produced by the two procedures were not  noticeably different. Since the gating currents of ILT and Shaw  S4:RRK move over a much greater voltage range than those of  <italic>Shaker</italic>, leak subtraction traces had to be taken in the voltage  range of channel opening. Possible artifacts due to charge movement during leak pulses were minimized by choosing voltages for  the leak subtraction where the kinetics of the channel are much  slower (at least an order of magnitude) than the gating current  signal of interest. For gating current recordings of nonconducting ILT, leak subtraction was performed using a &#x0002b;P/10 protocol  from a holding voltage of &#x0002b;20 mV. For gating current recordings  from nonconducting Shaw S4:RRK, we used a &#x0002b;P/5 leak subtraction protocol from a holding potential of &#x0002b;20 mV. For all cut-open oocyte clamp experiments, the oocyte membrane was held  at &#x02212;40 mV, and then stepped to &#x02212;100 mV for 2 s before initiating more negative prepulse steps (prepulse voltages were &#x02212;120  mV for <italic>Shaker</italic>, &#x02212;140 mV for ILT, and &#x02212;180 mV for Shaw S4: RRK), followed by test pulses. The properties of the gating currents did not change during the elapsed time of experiments.  Details of voltage protocols, including prepulse voltages and durations, are given in the figure legends.</p><p>The inside-out patch clamp configuration was used to measure  gating currents from nonconducting and conducting versions of  ILT and Shaw S4 channels. Typical pipette resistances were 0.4&#x02013; 0.8 M&#x003a9;. The details of voltage protocols are given in the figure  legends. Gating currents were digitized at 25 &#x003bc;s/point and filtered  at 9 kHz. Standard patch clamp recording solutions (described  above) were used, except at very positive voltages (greater than  &#x0002b;100 mV). At voltages greater than &#x0002b;100 mV, patches containing nonconducting (W434F) ILT and Shaw S4 channels develop  an outward ionic current that interferes with recording of gating  currents. The outward current can be eliminated by perfusing  the intracellular side of the inside-out patches with a K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-free solution containing (mM): 140 <italic>N</italic>-methylglucamine (NMG)&#x02013;Cl, 11  EGTA, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.1 with NMG-OH. The outward current is probably caused by potassium conductance  through the pores of the mutant <italic>Shaker</italic> channels, since the  W434F <italic>Shaker</italic> mutant is not strictly &#x0201c;nonconducting,&#x0201d; but has a  very small open probability (&#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Yang et al., 1997</xref>), and the  size of the ionic current was found to correlate with the size of  the gating currents in the patches. In most inside-out patch experiments on ILT gating currents, the holding potential was 0  mV. The holding potential can be held at &#x02212;80, &#x02212;40, or 0 mV without introducing any detectable changes in the amplitude or time  course of gating currents in a given patch, at least over the time  course of our experiments. A holding potential of 0 mV was used  for Shaw S4 gating current experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analysis</title><p>For <italic>Shaker</italic>, conductance&#x02013;voltage curves were constructed by calculation of the chord conductance (<italic>G</italic><sub>chord</sub>) from maximum currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>) during the test pulse at several voltages (V) assuming  a reversal potential (V<sub>rev</sub>) of &#x02212;80 mV: <italic>G</italic><sub>chord</sub> &#x0003d; <italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>/(V &#x02212; V<sub>rev</sub>).  For all other channel species, conductance&#x02013;voltage curves were  constructed from isochronal measurements of tail currents recorded at a fixed voltage after steps to voltages that activate the  channels. Isochronal measurements were made between 0.2 and  1 ms after the end of the test pulse. Conductance&#x02013;voltage curves  were normalized to the maximum value for comparison between  patches and between channel species.

There are 11  amino acid differences between the Shaw S4 chimera  and <italic>Shaker</italic>. Three of these occur at positions occupied  by basic residues in <italic>Shaker</italic> (R1, R2, and K7), decreasing  the charge content of the S4 from &#x0002b;7 in <italic>Shaker</italic> to &#x0002b;3 in  the Shaw S4 chimera. The ILT mutant substitutes three  noncharged residues (V369I, I372L, and S376T) from  the Shaw S4 sequence into <italic>Shaker</italic>, so the nominal  charge of the S4 region of the ILT is &#x0002b;7, like <italic>Shaker</italic>.</p><p>Despite the greater degree of similarity between the  S4 regions of ILT and <italic>Shaker</italic>, the properties of the  ionic currents of ILT are very similar to those of Shaw  S4. The steady state, kinetic, and voltage-dependent properties of the ionic currents are summarized in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>  and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. A more thorough analysis of the ionic current  behavior of Shaw S4 and ILT is presented in Smith-Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1998a</xref>,b).</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows ionic current traces and conductance&#x02013; voltage curves of <italic>Shaker</italic>, Shaw S4, and ILT. The Shaw  S4 and ILT mutations cause a large shift in the midpoint of the voltage dependence of channel opening  (&#x0002b;120 mV) and a considerable decrease (2.7-fold) in  the steepness of the conductance&#x02013;voltage relation relative to <italic>Shaker</italic>. It is also apparent in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> that the Shaw  S4 and ILT mutations affect activation kinetics. The  ionic current traces in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> show that the ILT and  Shaw S4 mutations greatly slow the overall rate of activation in the voltage range where channel opening  probability is changing.</p><p>The effects of the Shaw S4 and ILT mutations on the  time course of activation kinetics can be seen more  readily in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The overall rate of activation of wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> channels is fast, but the time course of activation is clearly sigmoidal and, at most voltages, there is  a considerable delay after stepping to a new voltage before the current starts to rise (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Zagotta et al.,  1994a</xref>). This delay indicates that <italic>Shaker</italic> channels must  undergo multiple transitions between closed states before opening. Further, the multiple transitions must  have similar rates and voltage dependences because if  one transition were rate limiting, it would dominate the  time course of activation and produce a single-exponential time course. The fact that the early time course  of wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> activation cannot be fit with a single  exponential function is illustrated clearly in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>,  where single exponential fits to the late phase of activation are shown superimposed on current traces.</p><p>The overall rate of activation of Shaw S4 and ILT  channels is greatly slowed relative to <italic>Shaker</italic>, but, more  importantly, the time course of activation of ionic currents of the mutants follows a single exponential time  course over a wide voltage range. Analysis of the shape  of the time course of activation of ionic currents is important because it can be used to distinguish mutations  that primarily affect cooperativity from those that affect  independent transitions. The slow, single-exponential  gating kinetics of Shaw S4 and ILT suggest that these  mutations alter activation gating by slowing a single  transition in the activation pathway sufficiently to make  it rate limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>,b). Since  the mutant channels presumably assemble into tetramers of four identical subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">MacKinnon, 1991</xref>), the  rate-limiting transition in Shaw S4 and ILT activation  most likely arises from highly cooperative interactions  between subunits. On the other hand, if a mutation  slowed a transition that occurs independently in each  of the four subunits of the channel, the time course of  activation would be determined by four slow but identical transitions in the pathway to opening; as a result,  the overall rate of activation would be slowed but the  shape of the time course would be sigmoidal, not single-exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>).</p><p>All of the properties of the ionic currents of the Shaw  S4 and ILT mutants can be accounted for by making a  final cooperative step in a kinetic model of <italic>Shaker</italic> rate  limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998b</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref> found that the rate-limiting transition is so dominant in the activation process that the  properties of the ionic currents of Shaw S4 and ILT can  also be described well by a simpler two-state kinetic  scheme in which the rate-limiting cooperative step is  the only transition in the activation pathway. This finding suggests that effects of these mutations on other  transitions in the activation pathway would be difficult  to resolve at the level of ionic currents, but they should  be visible at the level of gating currents.</p></sec><sec><title>Charge Movement between Closed States in ILT</title><p>The properties of the <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT gating currents  measured at negative voltages are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.  These measurements were made from nonconducting  versions of <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT, containing the mutation  W434F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>), in the cut-open oocyte  clamp configuration.</p><p>The charge movement measured for ILT in the &#x02212;140  to 0 mV voltage range must be associated with transitions between closed states because it moves in a voltage range where the channel does not open. The ILT  mutation causes a negative shift (&#x0223c;38 mV) in the voltage dependence of this component of charge movement and reduces the steepness of the <italic>Q</italic>V curve (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>  C) relative to wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>. The movement of this  component of gating charge saturates by &#x02212;40 mV,  which is 60 mV below the threshold of activation of  ionic currents. There must be an additional component of charge movement in the voltage range of channel opening since the opening transition is voltage dependent. However, the gating charge that moves in the  voltage range of channel opening could not be measured using the cut-open oocyte clamp technique because outward ionic currents develop at positive voltages and interfere with gating current recordings. The  additional component of gating charge can be measured using inside-out patches (discussed below).</p><p>The ON gating currents of ILT strongly resemble those  of <italic>Shaker</italic> in overall time course and relative voltage dependence, except that they activate in a more negative  voltage range. Notably, both channels exhibit a rising  phase in the ON gating currents, which is consistent with  sequential steps in which a slower or less voltage-dependent transition is followed by a faster or more voltage-dependent transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bezanilla  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998a</xref>,c). The time  constants measured from exponential fits to the decay  phase of the ON gating currents are shifted to negative  potentials compared with <italic>Shaker</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D). However,  the amplitudes of the time constants of decay converge  at voltages above 0 mV, consistent with the forward  transitions in the activation pathways of <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT  possessing similar rates and voltage dependences.</p><p>The similarities observed between the ON gating currents of ILT and those of <italic>Shaker</italic> strongly suggest that  <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT channels have similar activation pathways. Considering the conservative nature of the individual amino acid substitutions introduced by the ILT  mutation and the results from the analysis of ILT gating and ionic currents, it seems reasonable to propose  that ILT channels undergo essentially the same conformational changes as wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> during activation  and that the ILT mutation simply alters the rates and  equilibria of some transitions in the activation pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>An Additional Component of ILT Gating Charge in the  Voltage Range of Channel Opening</title><p>The large separation in voltage range between the  charge movement (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and the voltage-dependent  channel opening (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) of ILT indicates that there  must be an additional component of charge movement  in the voltage range of channel opening. Measurements of the charge movement in the voltage range of  channel opening will allow us to assess whether or not  the rate-limiting cooperative step is the only charge-moving step in this voltage range. If the rate-limiting  cooperative step is the only charge-moving gating transition in this voltage range, then: (a) the amount of  gating charge measured in this voltage range should be  in close agreement with the amount of charge associated with the rate-limiting cooperative transition as estimated from the voltage dependence of the rates of the  opening and closing transitions, and (b) the time constants of decay of the ON gating currents in the voltage  range of channel opening should have the same amplitude and voltage dependence as the time constants of  activation of the ILT ionic currents.</p><p>Gating current traces from a typical experiment in inside-out patches are depicted in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A. We designed  voltage protocols to measure separately the charge  movement at negative voltages and the charge movement in the voltage range of channel opening. First, we  measured charge movement in the &#x02212;140 to 0 mV  range, where the channel does not open, in inside-out  patches. We then changed the holding potential of the  membrane to 0 mV to allow charge movement between  closed states to reach equilibrium. From a holding potential of 0 mV, we stepped briefly to high voltages  (&#x0002b;100 to &#x0002b;180 mV), where channels open, to elicit  charge movement associated specifically with the late  transitions to the open state. </p><p>The gating currents measured at high voltages,  where channels open, are much smaller than those  measured in the same patch at negative voltages. Note  that the scale bars for gating currents measured in the  two different voltage ranges in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> differ by an order  of magnitude. Unfortunately, over much of the voltage  range of interest, the ILT gating charge movement associated with the rate-limiting transition to opening  cannot be measured because the amount of charge  moved is very small and the time constant of gating  charge movement is prohibitively slow (time constants  for ILT ionic currents are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Even in  patches with very large numbers of channels, the gating  charge signal is too small and slow to measure unless  the membrane voltage is stepped to at least &#x0002b;130 mV.  It is interesting to note that the gating currents at high  voltages display a bit of a rising phase, a feature that  could not be produced by a single transition. However,  the presence of a rising phase should be interpreted  with caution as it may be an artifact introduced by the  leak subtraction procedure at these very high voltages  rather than a true feature of the gating currents.</p><p>The voltage dependences of the total gating charge  movement and of channel opening of ILT are shown  plotted on the same graph in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B. The charge&#x02013;voltage curve was constructed from the data obtained in  the two different voltage ranges (&#x02212;140 to 0 mV and 0  to &#x0002b;180 mV) by summing the amount of gating charge  measured at high voltages with the amount of gating  charge measured with steps to &#x02212;20 mV, where the early  component of gating charge movement has clearly saturated.</p><p>Gating current recordings detect the charge movement associated with all charge-moving transitions in  the activation pathway. We can make use of this fact to  determine whether or not the rate-limiting transition is  the only charge-moving transition in the voltage range  of channel opening. If the rate-limiting transition is the  only gating transition that the ILT channel undergoes  in the 0- to &#x0002b;180-mV voltage range, then the amount of  gating charge measured in this voltage range should be  in close agreement with the amount of charge estimated from the voltage dependence of the rates of the  rate-limiting opening and closing transitions. On the  other hand, if ILT undergoes additional charge-moving transitions that are not rate limiting in the 0- to  &#x0002b;180-mV range, then the amount of gating charge  measured in this voltage range must exceed the  amount of charge estimated from the voltage dependences of the rates of the rate-limiting step.</p><p>The voltage dependence of the rates of the opening  and closing transitions corresponds to equivalent charge  values of 0.84 and 0.90 e<sub>0</sub>, respectively, for a total of  1.74 e<sub>0</sub> predicted to move in the final opening step  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998b</xref>). Thus, 1.74 e<sub>0</sub> represents  a lower bound estimate for the amount of gating  charge that must move per channel in this voltage  range to account for the voltage dependence of the  rate-limiting step, and additional voltage-dependent  steps will increase the amount of the gating charge  measured in the 0- to &#x0002b;180-mV range. Assuming that  the total gating charge per channel is between 12.3 and  13.6 e<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>), the proportion of  gating charge moved in the rate-limiting transition corresponds to 13&#x02013;14% of the total gating charge.</p><p>We determined the proportions of the total gating  charge moved in the two voltage ranges of interest by  measuring the charge moved by steps to voltages where  the two components of charge were observed to saturate. The high-voltage component was measured with  steps to &#x0002b;180 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV,  and the low-voltage component was measured with  steps to &#x02212;20 mV from a prepulse potential of &#x02212;140  mV. The total gating charge was taken to be the sum of  these two values. We calculated that 13% (SEM, 0.9%;  <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4) of the total gating charge moved in the voltage  range where channels open and 87% (SEM, 1.2%; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d;  4) moved between &#x02212;140 and &#x02212;20 mV. Given that the  amount of charge moved in the activation pathway per  wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> channel has been estimated to be between 12.3 and 13.6 e<sub>0</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aggarwal  and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>), these proportions correspond to gating charge movements per  channel of 1.6&#x02013;1.8 e<sub>0</sub> in the 0- to &#x0002b;180-mV range and  10.7&#x02013;11.8 e<sub>0</sub> in the &#x02212;140- to &#x02212;20-mV range. We assumed that the amount of gating charge moved per  ILT channel is the same as for wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> based on  reports in the literature that mutations at neutral residues in the S4 and at the carboxy-terminal border of  the S4 do not change the total amount of gating charge  moved per channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aggarwal  and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The amount of gating charge that moves in the voltage range of channel opening, 1.6&#x02013;1.8 e<sub>0</sub>, is in very  close agreement with the value for equivalent charge  associated with the rate-limiting transition, 1.74 e<sub>0</sub>, estimated from analysis of the voltage dependence of the  rates of channel opening and closing in ionic currents  from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref>. The agreement between these two independent determinations provides  strong evidence that the only charge-moving step in the  0- to &#x0002b;180-mV range is the rate-limiting cooperative  step that dominates the behavior of the ionic currents.</p><p>If the ILT gating charge movement at high voltages is  associated with the rate-limiting cooperative transition  between the final closed and open states, then the kinetics of the gating currents should be the same as the  kinetics of the ionic currents. The voltage dependence  of the time constants of decay of the ON gating currents at high voltages is shown plotted on the same  graph as mean time constants of activation of ionic currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C). The gating current time constants have  the same voltage dependence (slope) as the ionic current activation time constants, but the gating currents  are noticeably faster than the ionic currents.</p><p>The discrepancy between the kinetics of the gating  and ionic currents deviates from the prediction of a  singe transition. However, it can be explained in terms  of a voltage shift between the gating current and ionic  current data (see <sc>discussion</sc>). If the voltage shift is  corrected for, the amplitude and voltage dependence  of the kinetics of the gating currents recorded in the  voltage range of channel opening are consistent with  those expected to accompany the gating charge movement during the rate-limiting cooperative transition  that opens the ILT channel. Given that the amount of  charge moved in this voltage range is in such close  agreement with the equivalent charge measured for  the rate-limiting cooperative transition based on the  voltage dependence of the rates of ionic current activation and deactivation, it seems likely that the rate-limiting cooperative transition is the final charge-moving  step in the activation pathway. Therefore, in spite of  the voltage shift between the kinetics of the gating and  ionic currents, it seems likely that the charge movement that we have measured corresponds to the charge  moved in the rate-limiting cooperative step. The simplest interpretation of these findings is that the ILT  mutation has uncovered the final voltage-dependent  cooperative transition in the <italic>Shaker</italic> activation pathway  by making it rate limiting.</p></sec><sec><title>The Activation Pathway of Shaw S4</title><p>The similar properties of the ionic currents of ILT and  Shaw S4 imply that these two channels gate in the same  way. However, the gating currents of Shaw S4 indicate  that its activation pathway is fundamentally different  from that of ILT.</p><p>The only gating charge that could be detected for  nonconducting Shaw S4 channels moves at very positive voltages, in a voltage range where channels open  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). We could not detect any Shaw S4 charge movement in the voltage range where most of the charge  moves in the activation pathways of ILT and <italic>Shaker</italic>. The  Shaw S4 gating currents strongly resemble the component of ILT gating currents recorded in the voltage  range of channel opening (shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A) in shape  and time course. As noted previously for ILT, the Shaw  S4 gating currents cannot be measured over much of  the voltage range of channel opening because the time  constants of gating charge movement are prohibitively  slow and the amount of charge moved is very small.</p><p>We cannot use the method applied to ILT to determine the amount of Shaw S4 gating charge moved at  high voltages because of the absence of Shaw S4 gating  charge at low voltages. However, we can measure time  constants from currents elicited with steps to sufficiently positive voltages. The time constants of decay of  the ON gating currents are shown plotted as a function  of voltage on the same graph as time constants of activation of Shaw S4 ionic currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, B and C). The  kinetics of the gating currents are faster than the kinetics of the ionic currents but have a similar voltage dependence. The faster gating current kinetics correspond to a voltage shift of 20&#x02013;25 mV relative to the  ionic currents. This voltage shift is similar in magnitude  to the voltage shift observed between the kinetics of the  ionic and gating currents of ILT and probably occurs  for similar reasons (see <sc>discussion).</sc></p><p>The absence of charge movement between closed  states in nonconducting Shaw S4 channels indicates  that the chemical or steric properties of some of the  substituted S4 residues may interfere with the normal  conformational changes of the channel protein during  gating. If the Shaw S4 gating charge detected in the  voltage range of channel opening is associated with the  rate-limiting cooperative transition, then the activation  pathway of Shaw S4 moves as little as &#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub> per channel, or 0.45 e<sub>0</sub> per subunit. This value is less than expected considering the charge-changing substitutions  in the S4 region of Shaw S4. While there are three  charge-changing substitutions between the S4 of Shaw  S4 and <italic>Shaker</italic>, only two of these substitutions occur at  residues that have been shown to contribute to the gating charge of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aggarwal and MacKinnon,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Seoh et al., 1996</xref>). With eight charge-moving residues per tetrameric channel protein remaining (i.e.,  two charge-moving residues per subunit), we would expect to see some charge movement between closed  states in addition to the 1.8 e<sub>0</sub> per channel moved during the last cooperative transition.</p><p>It is also possible that the S4 mutations might interact  with the pore mutation, W434F, to produce an anomalous gating phenotype. To address this possibility, we  performed a series of gating current experiments with  conducting ILT and Shaw S4 channels. In these experiments, we also extended the voltage range of investigation down to &#x02212;240 mV in an attempt to measure Shaw  S4 gating currents.</p><p>We selected inside-out patches that expressed very  high levels of conducting channels and measured the  amount of ionic current elicited by steps to &#x0002b;100 mV,  then we tried to detect gating currents in the same  patch in the &#x02212;140 to 0 mV range, where most of the  charge moves in the ILT activation pathway. A representative experiment for each channel is shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. In patches expressing ILT channels, we were able to  detect robust gating currents with steps to &#x02212;140 to 0  mV in every patch that had at least 3.7 nA of ionic current at &#x0002b;100 mV. In patches expressing Shaw S4 channels, we were not able to detect any gating currents in  the voltage range of &#x02212;200 to 0 mV, even though we biased our experiments towards having more ionic current at &#x0002b;100 mV (i.e., more channels per patch) in the  Shaw S4 experiments than the ILT experiments. For 6/11  patches of Shaw S4, we extended the voltage range of  investigation with steps down to &#x02212;240 mV (patches  could not withstand more negative pulses), but we still  did not detect gating currents in any patches expressing Shaw S4.</p><p>The results of similar experiments on many patches  are tabulated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>. To interpret data across  patches that had different numbers of channels, we  normalized the data by calculating the ratio of gating  charge at 0 mV to ionic current at &#x0002b;100 mV. The scatter in the q/K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> current data is probably due to series  resistance error introduced by the very large ionic currents that were measured. The accuracy of measurements of current at &#x0002b;100 mV would be quite sensitive  to series resistance errors because the probability of  opening is still changing (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, the direction of the series resistance error would cause us to  underestimate systematically the true amount of ionic  current at &#x0002b;100 mV, which in turn would cause us to  overestimate the amount of gating charge moved relative to the true amount of ionic current. Our interpretation of these experiments would not be compromised  by systematically underestimating the amount of ionic  current at &#x0002b;100 mV.</p><p>As in the case of ILT, the discrepancy between the kinetics of the gating and the ionic currents of Shaw S4  can be explained readily in terms of a voltage shift, the  possible causes of which will be presented in the <sc>discussion</sc>. If the voltage shift is corrected for, the amplitude and voltage dependence of the kinetics of the gating currents recorded in the voltage range of channel  opening are consistent with those expected to accompany the gating charge movement during the rate-limiting cooperative transition that opens the Shaw S4  channel. Therefore, it seems likely that the charge  movement that we have measured corresponds to the  charge moved in the rate-limiting cooperative step.  Further, it seems likely that the rate-limiting cooperative transition is the only charge-moving step in the activation pathway of Shaw S4, since we could not detect  charge movement between closed states in the Shaw S4  mutant.</p><p>Although we could not detect gating charge movement between closed states in the Shaw S4 mutant using the methods described above, these methods do  not prove the absence of such gating charge. Gating  charge from a slow transition between closed states  might escape detection using these methods. However,  the presence of a slow transition between closed states  should manifest itself in the sigmoidicity of the time  course of activation. This possibility will be addressed  experimentally in the following section.</p></sec><sec><title>Closed States in the ILT Activation Pathway Produce a  &#x0201c;Cole-Moore Shift&#x0201d; that Is Absent in Shaw S4 Ionic Currents</title><p>The time course of activation of <italic>Shaker</italic> is fast, but at  most voltages it is sigmoidal in shape and exhibits a  large delay before the current starts to rise (discussed  above; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Zagotta et al., 1994a</xref>). This delay indicates that <italic>Shaker</italic> channels must undergo a number of  voltage-dependent transitions between closed states before it can open. Depolarized holding voltages cause a  decrease in the amount of delay in the time course of  <italic>Shaker</italic> activation, presumably because channels now occupy states along the activation pathway that are closer  to the open state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Zagotta et al., 1994a</xref>).  A decrease in the delay in the time course of activation  in response to depolarized holding potentials is often  referred to as a Cole-Moore shift because the phenomenon was first observed in squid potassium channels by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cole and Moore (1960)</xref>.</p><p>The presence of more closed states in the activation  pathway of ILT than Shaw S4 can be seen on close investigation of the time course of activation of ionic currents. The properties of the ionic currents of Shaw S4  and ILT are very similar. However, at voltages above  &#x0002b;140 mV, the time course of activation of ILT develops  a very small but progressive increase in delay that is essentially absent from Shaw S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al.,  1998b</xref>).</p><p>From studying the voltage dependence of charge  movement of ILT, we know that gating currents begin  to activate at &#x02212;130 mV and that charge movement between closed states saturates around &#x02212;40 mV. Therefore, a prepulse to &#x02212;140 mV should draw ILT channels  into the closed state furthest from the open state,  which will maximize the amount of delay in activation.  The behavior of the ILT gating currents suggests that a  prepulse to 0 mV should pool ILT channels into the final closed state adjacent to the open state, which will  minimize the amount of delay in the time course of activation.</p><p>The results of prepulse experiments on the time  course of activation of Shaw S4 and ILT are presented  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. The time course of Shaw S4 ionic currents is  insensitive to the choice of prepulse voltage for all voltages tested (&#x02212;180 to 0 mV). This result confirms that  there are no slow charge-moving transitions between  closed states that may have escaped detection in our  gating current measurements. </p><p>In contrast, the ILT current traces clearly show that  prepulses to &#x02212;140 mV induce a small amount of delay  and prepulses to 0 mV relieve this delay. When patches  containing ILT channels are prepulsed to 0 mV, which  effectively removes the closed state transitions from the  ILT activation pathway, the time course of activation of  ILT is more like that of Shaw S4 at all voltages (see superimposed Shaw S4 and ILT current traces of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A,  bottom). Thus, the small increase in the amount of delay in the ionic currents of ILT at voltages above &#x0002b;140  mV observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref> can be accounted for by the presence of transitions between  closed states in the activation pathway.</p><p>The amount of delay present in traces was quantitated by taking the x intercept of single exponential  fits to current traces (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B). The amount of delay  measured is very small, even for ILT after prepulses  to &#x02212;140 mV. However, a simple first-order reaction  (e.g., between a closed state and the open state) would  produce a time course of activation with no delay. The  small amount of delay observed in Shaw S4 traces that  remains in ILT traces after prepulses to 0 mV is consistent with either a highly cooperative transition or with  the presence of multiple charge-moving transitions. Since  our gating current data indicate that there is only one  charge-moving transition in this voltage range for Shaw  S4 and ILT activation, the former explanation seems  more likely. The small amount of delay observed for  Shaw S4 and ILT after prepulses to 0 mV and the small  rising phase on the gating currents are both consistent  with a cooperative conformational change in which the  movement of each subunit facilitates the others.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations at Charged Residues Affect Charge Movement  between Closed States</title><p>The voltage dependence of the cooperative opening  transition is the same for ILT and Shaw S4, but there is  no detectable charge movement between closed states  in the activation pathway of Shaw S4 in the voltage  range of &#x02212;240 to 0 mV, where a large component of  the ILT gating charge moves. The S4 sequence of Shaw  S4 has charge-changing substitutions at three positions  occupied by basic residues (R1, R2, and K7) in <italic>Shaker</italic>  and ILT, resulting in a decrease in the net charge of  the S4 from &#x0002b;7 to &#x0002b;3. To test if increasing the net S4  charge of Shaw S4 could rescue the charge movement  between closed states, we constructed a mutant, Shaw  S4:RRK, that contains all seven of the basic residues  present in <italic>Shaker</italic> and all eight of the substitutions at  noncharged residues present in the Shaw S4 chimera  (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The properties of the ionic currents of Shaw S4:RRK  are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>. The voltage range of activation of Shaw S4:RRK is shifted negatively relative to  ILT, but the slope of the conductance&#x02013;voltage relation  of Shaw S4:RRK is similar to that of ILT and considerably more shallow than that of <italic>Shaker</italic>. The time course  of activation of Shaw S4:RRK shows little delay and is  well described by a single-exponential function over  the activation voltage range, consistent with the presence of a rate-limiting step in the activation pathway.  The time constants of activation and deactivation of  Shaw S4:RRK are similar to those of ILT in their amplitude and voltage dependence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C), but the relationship has been shifted to a more negative voltage  range. Analysis of the voltage dependence of channel  kinetics indicates that, for the Shaw S4:RRK mutant,  0.94 e<sub>0</sub> are associated with channel opening and 0.95 e<sub>0  </sub>with channel closing, for a total of 1.89 e<sub>0</sub> associated  with the rate-limiting cooperative transition. These  equivalent charge values for the forward and backward  rates of the rate-limiting transition are very similar to  the charge estimates obtained for ILT of (0.84 e<sub>0</sub> for  channel opening and 0.90 e<sub>0 </sub>for channel closing, for a  total of 1.74 e<sub>0</sub>) and for Shaw S4 (0.78 e<sub>0</sub> for channel  opening and 0.86 e<sub>0</sub> for channel closing, for a total of  1.64 e<sub>0</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998b</xref>). </p><p>Overall, the properties of the ionic currents of Shaw  S4:RRK are very similar to those of ILT and Shaw S4,  suggesting that the properties of the rate-limiting final  cooperative step in the gating pathway have not been  changed by the substitutions at R1, R2, and K7, except  for a shift in its voltage-dependent equilibrium. The  ionic current properties of Shaw S4:RRK might be expected to resemble those of ILT and Shaw S4 because  the Shaw S4:RRK mutant includes all of the substitutions (i.e., the ILT mutations V369I, I372L, and S376T)  necessary to make the last cooperative gating transition  rate limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998b</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the effects of the Shaw S4:RRK mutation on earlier transitions in the activation pathway, we  examined the properties of the gating currents (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). We found that Shaw S4:RRK gating currents can  be recorded at voltages that are more negative than the  voltage range of channel opening, demonstrating the  presence of charge-moving conformational changes between closed states in the activation pathway. However,  the gating currents of Shaw S4:RRK are quite different  from those of <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The midpoint  of the charge&#x02013;voltage curve of Shaw S4:RRK is shifted  to an even more negative voltage range and its slope is  even more shallow than that of ILT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> B). Moreover, the behavior of the ON gating currents is not consistent with a simple voltage shift relative to <italic>Shaker</italic> and  ILT. The time constants of Shaw S4:RRK are considerably slower and have a noticeably more shallow voltage  dependence than the time constants for <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT  gating currents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> C; also, note the difference in  time scale used to display the Shaw S4:RRK gating currents in Fig.10 compared with <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).  The Shaw S4:RRK OFF gating currents are also much  slower than those of <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT. </p><p>The relationship between gating charge movement  and activation of ionic currents of Shaw S4:RRK is summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, top) The charge- and conductance-voltage curves are plotted on the same graph.  The threshold at which ionic currents can be detected  is &#x02212;30 mV. The charge&#x02013;voltage curve has reached apparent saturation by &#x02013;30 mV and does not increase with  increasingly positive voltage steps in the voltage range  considered (up to &#x0002b;20 mV), despite the fact that an additional component of charge movement would be expected to move during the rate-limiting transition to  channel opening in this voltage range. However, the  charge movement associated with the rate-limiting  transition is too slow to be detected in the ON gating  currents in the voltage range of &#x02212;30 to &#x0002b;20 mV. We  did not attempt to measure gating currents at still  higher voltages, where the charge moved during the  rate-limiting transition would be fast enough to measure, because outward currents develop at higher voltages in the cut-open oocyte configuration and interfere  with measurements of gating currents. </p><p>To test whether or not these closed states are coupled  to channel opening, we can look for an increase in the  amount of delay in the time course of activation with  appropriately negative prepulses. The traces shown in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> B demonstrate that the amount of delay in the  time course of activation of Shaw S4:RRK can be increased by a prepulse to &#x02212;140 mV and decreased by a  prepulse to &#x02212;40 mV. Therefore, the voltage-dependent  transitions between closed states that we detected as  gating currents are traversed in the activation pathway.  For comparison, current traces are also shown from  similar experiments performed on ILT and Shaw S4.  The relatively large delays in the ionic currents of Shaw  S4:RRK produced by negative prepulse voltages are  consistent with the slow kinetics of its gating currents  compared with those of ILT.</p><p>The relationship between the gating behavior of  Shaw S4:RRK, ILT, and Shaw S4 is consistent with the  idea that the rate-limiting transition is late in the activation pathway and with previous work that has shown  that R1 and R2 move through the membrane electric  field during early gating transitions and that K7 never  crosses the electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Baker  et al., 1998</xref>). The rate-limiting transition in the Shaw  S4:RRK activation pathway displays a voltage dependence similar to that of ILT and Shaw S4, suggesting  that the charges at R1, R2, and K7 do not traverse the  membrane electric field during the final cooperative  transition. The gating current recordings and Cole-Moore type experiments on ILT, Shaw S4, and Shaw  S4:RRK confirm that R1, R2, and K7 traverse the membrane electric field during earlier gating transitions.</p></sec><sec><title>A Kinetic Model for ILT</title><p>To further understand the changes introduced by the  ILT mutation, we modified a kinetic model that was developed for <italic>Shaker</italic>. The rationale for modifying a <italic>Shaker</italic>  model is that the ILT mutation should not grossly alter  the gating mechanism because the amino acid substitutions introduced into the protein by this mutation are  very conservative, producing small changes in the size  and shape but not the chemistry of the amino acid side  chains. In support of this idea, the gating currents of  ILT in the &#x02212;140- to 0-mV range were found to resemble those of <italic>Shaker</italic>, indicating that ILT and <italic>Shaker</italic> undergo similar numbers and types of conformational  changes between closed states. Also, the individual substitution of any one of the amino acids in the ILT mutant (V369I, I372L, S376T) causes much smaller changes  in gating than is observed for the ILT triple mutant,  suggesting that the structure of the protein readily accommodates each of the individual substitutions  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998b</xref>). The state diagram for  the <italic>Shaker</italic> model is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> A, and the rates  and voltage dependences for the rate constants used  are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>.  </p><p>In this paper, we have used a 16-state model for  <italic>Shaker</italic> activation. In this model, each subunit undergoes two sequential independent transitions to reach a  final closed state from which the channel opens cooperatively. A single transition has been used to represent  the final cooperative transition, which may be more  complex. Quantitative agreement between model predictions and <italic>Shaker</italic> data can be improved by addition of  more states to this class of kinetic model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa  and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>). In the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and  Sigworth (1998c)</xref>, each subunit undergoes an additional independent transition, followed by two sequential cooperative transitions to reach the open state.  However, we have used a 16-state model for <italic>Shaker</italic> because it is the simplest model that adequately describes  most of the features of <italic>Shaker</italic> gating and ionic currents.</p><p>The 16-state model is similar to the 15-state model  proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al. (1994b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell  et al. (1998b)</xref>, except in its treatment of the last transition between the final closed state and the open state.  In the 15-state model, there is no final closed state from  which the channel opens cooperatively. Rather, cooperativity is implemented by slowing the first closing  transition. The 15- and 16-state models describe wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> ionic and gating currents equally well. Both  the 15- and 16-state models can be readily adapted to  describe the ionic currents of ILT; however, only the  16-state model can be adapted to describe the behavior  of ILT gating currents. The 15-state model cannot produce the two well-separated components of gating current that were observed for ILT. This result strongly  suggests that the molecular mechanism of cooperativity  in the rate-limiting step in the activation of ILT is a  highly cooperative step rather than a stabilization of  the open state. The ability of a 16-state model to describe simultaneously the gating and ionic currents of  ILT suggests that a 16-state model, in which the channel reaches a final closed state from which it opens cooperatively, represents a more reasonable approximation of the conformational changes of the protein than  the 15-state model.</p><p>The model predictions for wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> and ILT  gating currents are compared with data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>. The  wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> model does a good job of predicting  many features of the <italic>Shaker</italic> gating currents, including a  rising phase in the ON gating currents, a rising phase  in the OFF gating currents associated with channel  opening, and the position and steepness of the steady  state voltage dependence of gating charge movement.  The predictions for the time constants of decay of the  ON gating currents agree well with the data over the  &#x02212;30- to &#x0002b;50-mV range, but less well in the &#x02212;70- to &#x02212;40-mV range, as was also observed in the 15-state model of  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al. (1994b)</xref>. The agreement between the predictions of the time constant of decay of the ON gating  currents is improved significantly by adding a third independent transition per subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>). </p><p>The gating current predictions for the ILT model are  presented in two parts. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref>, the model predictions for gating currents in the &#x02212;140- to &#x0002b;20-mV  range, where charge moves between closed states, are  compared with ILT data in the same voltage range. In  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>, the model predictions for gating currents in  the voltage range of channel opening are compared  with ILT data. </p><p>To reproduce the behavior of ILT gating currents in  the &#x02212;140- to 0-mV range, it was necessary to slow both  of the independent backward transitions in each subunit relative to wild type <italic>Shaker</italic>, without changing the  independent forward transitions. The largest change to  the model was a 25-fold slowing of the rate of the &#x003b2;  transitions. The rate of the &#x003b4; transitions was slowed to a  lesser degree, 3.5-fold. The fit of the model to the data  was improved somewhat by slightly decreasing the  amount of charge assigned to the independent backward transitions. These alterations to the backward  transitions are sufficient to reproduce the features of  the ILT gating currents at negative voltages, including  the shift in the voltage dependence of the time constants and charge movement, the decrease in the slope  of the charge movement, and the overall time course of  the ON and OFF gating currents. Because the forward  transitions are unchanged, the time constants of decay  of the ON gating currents converge with those of the  <italic>Shaker</italic> model at 0 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">13</xref> D), as can be observed in  the data (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D). Although the voltage dependence of the last concerted transition must be increased for the ILT model, the total amount of gating  charge assigned is very similar to that of the model for  wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>: 13.8 e<sub>0</sub> for ILT and 13.2 e<sub>0</sub> for <italic>Shaker</italic>.</p><p>To reproduce the gating currents of ILT in the voltage range of channel opening, the forward and backward rates of the final cooperative transition in the  16-state <italic>Shaker</italic> model must both be slowed and their  voltage dependences must be increased relative to wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>. The forward and backward cooperative  transitions have been assigned equivalent charge values  of 1.0 and 0.8 e<sub>0</sub>, respectively, for a total of 1.8 e<sub>0</sub> assigned to the final cooperative transition. The parameters used in this paper for the forward and backward  transitions of the final cooperative step are the same as  in the model for ILT gating proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref>. The ionic currents predicted by the  ILT model proposed in this paper are indistinguishable  from those predicted by the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et  al. (1998b)</xref> (data not shown), despite the fact that the  kinetic model was modified in this paper to incorporate ILT gating current data between &#x02212;140 and 0 mV.  In this model, the voltage dependence of the last cooperative step must be increased significantly to reproduce ILT behavior, from 0.4 e<sub>0</sub> for wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> to  1.8 e<sub>0</sub> for ILT. However, the true voltage dependence  of the last cooperative transition in wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> is  not known for certain because the transition is too fast  to be investigated thoroughly. The nature of the last cooperative step in wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> will be discussed further in <sc>discussion.</sc></p><p>Gating current simulations were elicited from a holding voltage of 0 mV to isolate the component of charge  that moves in the activation range. The model predictions are shown superimposed on representative ILT  current traces in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref> A. The model does a very good  job of predicting the overall time course of ILT gating  charge movement over a wide voltage range, &#x0002b;130 to  &#x0002b;180 mV. The ILT model predictions were compared  with ILT gating currents from four different patches,  and the agreement between the model and the gating  currents was very good for all four patches over the  range of &#x0002b;130 to &#x0002b;180 mV.</p><p>However, the model does not predict the small rising  phase that is observed in the gating current recordings.  This discrepancy probably occurs because we have used  a concerted step (e.g., a single transition in which all of  the channel subunits move in unison) as an approximation for the cooperative step. A concerted step can be  thought of as an extreme case of cooperativity. The  presence of a small rising phase in the time course of  the ILT gating currents at high voltages suggests that  the channel undergoes a conformational change that is  highly cooperative but not concerted.</p><p>Overall, the gating currents in the voltage range of  channel opening of ILT are well described by the  model over a wide voltage range. The fit of the model  to the data provides additional evidence that the rate-limiting cooperative transition in the gating of ILT is  the final transition in the gating pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>A Kinetic Model for Shaw S4</title><p>We used a two-state model for Shaw S4 because it is  consistent with the single-exponential time course of  the ionic currents and the absence of gating currents at  voltages outside the activation voltage range. The state  diagram for the model is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>, and the rates  and voltage dependence for the rate constants used are  given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>. The values used for the rates in the  two-state model are the same as those used for the final  transition in the ILT model.</p><p>For the purpose of comparison, the gating current  predictions of the two-state Shaw S4 model and of the  multi-state ILT model in the voltage range of channel  opening have been presented together in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>. All  gating current simulations were elicited from a holding  voltage of 0 mV. The gating current predictions from  the ILT and Shaw S4 models are indistinguishable, except during the first 200 &#x003bc;s after depolarization (traces  are shown superimposed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref> C). It is unlikely  that we would detect this difference in our recordings,  since the first 200 &#x003bc;s after a step to a new voltage is typically obscured by capacitive transients.</p><p>The Shaw S4 model predictions were compared with  Shaw S4 gating currents from four different patches.  The model predictions agree very well with the Shaw S4  gating current recordings over the voltage range of  &#x0002b;130 to &#x0002b;160 mV, but around &#x0002b;170 mV the predictions of the model and the recorded currents start to  diverge. The model predictions are apparently too fast  at the highest voltages. We observed a similar but  smaller divergence between model and data for ILT at  &#x0002b;180 mV and higher. The degree to which model and  data diverged was consistently greater for Shaw S4 than  ILT but varied from patch-to-patch for both channels.</p><p>The divergence between model and data may indicate that the true channel behavior is more complicated than presented in the model. For example, our  model does not include any transitions of the open  channel to closed states that are not in the activation  pathway. Open <italic>Shaker</italic> channels can close to closed  states that are outside of the activation path, and the  rates for some of these transitions exhibit a small voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hoshi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998a</xref>). These transitions may make an increasingly significant contribution to the voltage-dependent  and kinetic behavior of the channel as the open probability approaches its maximum. Further, the rates of  transitions to closed states outside of the activation  path can be affected by mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998b</xref>). The difference between the gating currents of ILT and Shaw S4 at high voltages might indicate that Shaw S4 and ILT have different effects on the  transitions from the open state of the channel to states  outside of the activation pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>discussion</title><p>The simplest interpretation of the gating phenotype of  the ILT mutant is that the ILT mutation has uncovered  the final voltage-dependent cooperative transition in the  <italic>Shaker</italic> activation pathway by making it rate limiting.  The most compelling evidence for this interpretation  is the close agreement between the amount of gating  charge moved in the voltage range of channel opening  and the amount of charge moved in the forward and  backward transitions of the rate-limiting step, as estimated from fits to time constants of activation and deactivation. This result strongly suggests that the rate-limiting cooperative transition is the only charge-moving transition in the voltage range of channel opening,  and therefore it must be the last transition in the activation pathway. This interpretation of our results is further supported by the fact that the voltage dependence  of the ILT gating current kinetics at high voltages is the  same as the voltage dependence of the ionic currents.</p><p>However, the kinetics of the ILT gating currents are  noticeably faster than the ionic currents, when they  should be the same if the gating charge movement is  associated with the rate-limiting cooperative transition.  It is important for our interpretation of the gating current data to consider the nature of this discrepancy and  plausible mechanisms by which it could be produced.</p><p>Since the ionic and gating current kinetics have the  same voltage dependence, the difference in their kinetics can be interpreted as a voltage shift of &#x0223c;20 mV. If a  single charge-moving transition determines the properties of the conductance&#x02013;voltage and charge&#x02013;voltage  curves, then a 20-mV voltage shift can be produced by a  rather small energetic difference of &#x0223c;0.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,  using the relationship: <disp-formula><tex-math id="M4">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

An energetic difference of &#x0223c;0.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,  and hence a 20-mV voltage shift in the gating currents,  could be produced by a number of different mechanisms. We will discuss two mechanisms for which there  is experimental evidence, namely, the effects on gating  of the nonconducting conditions (the W434F mutation) used to measure gating currents, and variability in  voltage-dependent behavior between patches.</p><p>To record gating currents without interference from  ionic currents, we rendered channels nonconducting  by introducing the W434F mutation into the pore region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>). Originally, the W434F mutation was thought to block conduction of ions through  the pore of the open state of the channel without interfering with activation gating transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Perozo et al.,  1993</xref>). However, several lines of evidence now indicate  that the W434F mutation does not simply block conduction of ions and does affect gating near the open  state of the channel. It has been shown that the W434F  mutation decreases the probability of being open to  &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> by inactivating the channel, but does not block  conduction in a normal open state conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Yang  et al., 1997</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chen et al. (1997)</xref> found that the  W434F mutation at the homologous position in Kv1.5  slows the return of OFF gating currents after steps to  voltages where the channel opens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chen et al., 1997</xref>).  These results clearly demonstrate that the W434F mutation alters transitions near the open state of the channel, either between the last closed state in the activation pathway and the open state or between the open  state and closed states that are not traversed in the activation pathway.</p><p>To date, there is no direct evidence demonstrating  that the kinetics of the activation pathway are affected  by the W434F mutation. However, charge movement  associated with slower gating transitions could mask effects of the W434F mutation on very fast transitions.  Wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> undergoes a very fast forward transition (time constant of &#x0223c;100 &#x003bc;s) near the open state  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998a</xref>). Changes in the kinetics of this transition would be difficult to resolve even if  they were relatively large because the transition is an  order of magnitude faster than the charge movement  measured in our gating current records. If the W434F  mutation changes the energy of the final gating transition by as little as &#x0223c;0.8 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (e.g., the energy difference that is observed between the ON gating current  of ILT and the ionic currents), it would not cause a  measurable change in the ON gating currents of <italic>Shaker</italic>.  However, the ILT mutation may unmask the effects of  the W434F mutation on the kinetics of ON gating currents by isolating the last gating transition.</p><p>The observed voltage shift may also be due, at least in  part, to variability between patches. Variability in voltage-dependent behavior between patches has been observed in both wild-type and mutant <italic>Shaker</italic> channels  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998b</xref>,c).  The cause of this variability is not known, but it may be  the result of the action of various factors (e.g., kinases,  phosphatases, redox agents) that are present in oocytes. Our ILT and Shaw S4 gating current experiments  may be unusually biased in this respect because of the  extraordinary levels of channel expression that were required to produce a measurable signal for the small  component of gating current at high voltages. As a result, all of these recordings were obtained from two  batches of oocytes with exceptionally high levels of expression, and the gating current recordings will be biased towards the conditions found in these particular  batches of oocytes. Further, because of the need for  higher protein expression levels, gating currents were  typically recorded from much older oocytes than those  used to record ionic currents, and the age of the oocytes may be a factor in modification of channel by  such agents as phosphatases and kinases. Meanwhile,  ILT and Shaw S4 ionic currents could be measured  from many batches of oocytes and, interestingly, the  variability observed between patches has been considerable: the standard deviation of the midpoint of the conductance&#x02013;voltage curve is &#x000b1;10 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al.,  1998b</xref>). Such large variability in the midpoint of the  conductance&#x02013;voltage curve exceeds that expected based  on series resistance errors, as error due to series resistance in our experiments was generally &#x0003c;2 mV.</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that the voltage  shift (energy difference) observed between the kinetics of our ILT gating and the ionic currents is real and  that the gating mechanism of ILT is actually more  complicated than the mechanism presented in this paper. However, it is reasonable to suggest that the underlying small energy difference could be introduced by  either the W434F mutation or the different experimental conditions required to obtain gating currents versus  ionic currents. If the voltage shift is corrected for, the  amplitude and voltage dependence of the kinetics of  the gating currents recorded in the voltage range of  channel opening are consistent with those expected to  accompany the gating charge movement during the  last cooperative transition that opens the channel.  Therefore, in spite of the voltage shift, it seems likely  that the charge movement that we have measured corresponds to the charge moved in the rate-limiting cooperative step.</p><sec><title>Insights into the Activation Pathway</title><p>The ability to study the gating process in wild-type  <italic>Shaker</italic> is limited by the fact that it is difficult to study individual transitions independently of one another because the rates and voltage dependences of most of the  transitions in <italic>Shaker</italic> activation are too similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta  et al., 1994b</xref>). The ability to perturb the energies of gating transitions with mutations provides a means to dissect out steps in the gating pathway. For this reason, we  have studied the effects of mutations in the S4 region  in detail and interpreted the effects of the mutations,  when possible, in the context of a kinetic model for  <italic>Shaker</italic>. Using a similar approach, Schoppa and Sigworth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1998b</xref>,c) have gained insights into the gating  mechanism of <italic>Shaker</italic> using the V2 mutant.</p><p>For most of this discussion, we will focus on the ILT  mutation, since it does not introduce any charge-changing substitutions into the S4 of <italic>Shaker</italic> and has  been shown to be the least disruptive to the overall gating pathway of the three mutants in this study. Because  the ILT mutation makes the last cooperative gating  transition in activation rate limiting, we can study the  properties of this transition in isolation from other gating transitions. Through analysis of the voltage dependence of ionic and gating currents, we have been able  to determine that the equivalent charge associated with  this transition is &#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub>, and we have shown that the  rate-limiting cooperative transition is the final voltage-dependent transition in the gating pathway of ILT.</p><p>Our results also provide insight into the manner in  which cooperativity is implemented in the activation  pathway. Activation of wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> can be described  adequately with models in which cooperativity is implemented in one of two ways: (a) as a cooperative stabilization of the open state, as in the 15-state model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al. (1994b)</xref>, or (b) as a final cooperative transition(s) to the open state (this paper; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>). However, our  analysis of the ILT gating currents clearly supports the  existence of a final cooperative transition in the activation pathway.</p><p>Two lines of experimental evidence suggest that  there is a similar but much faster cooperative transition  to the open state in the activation pathway of wild-type  <italic>Shaker</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al. (1994b)</xref> found that the first closing transition in <italic>Shaker</italic> is slower than earlier backward  transitions, consistent with the presence of a strongly  forward-biased cooperative transition between the final  closed state of the channel and the open state (e.g., a  transition with a very fast forward rate and relatively  slow backward rate). But they concluded that if there is  a forward cooperative transition before channel opening, it is sufficiently fast as to be &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; in measurements of the activation kinetics of <italic>Shaker</italic>. Recently,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Schoppa and Sigworth (1998a)</xref> have used reactivation  voltage protocols to uncover a strongly forward-biased  cooperative transition near the open state. They found  that the forward transition is very fast, at least as fast as  9,100 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (which corresponds to a time constant on the  order of 100 &#x003bc;s). However, their estimate of the rate  and voltage dependence of this transition should be  considered as a lower bound because the time course  of such a fast transition may not be fully resolved from  the contribution of other slower transitions to the time  course of reactivation. Cooperative interactions in proteins can occur on time scales much faster than 100 &#x003bc;s.  For example, haemoglobin undergoes its oxy&#x02013;deoxyhaemoglobin conformational change in 20 &#x003bc;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Spiro et al.,  1990</xref>). Even if such a fast transition could be isolated  experimentally from slower transitions in the activation  pathway of wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>, it would be difficult to measure using standard electrophysiological techniques.</p><p>The amount of charge assigned to the cooperative final transition in ILT gating, &#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub>, is greater than the  amount of charge assigned to the final opening transition of <italic>Shaker</italic> in all kinetic models of <italic>Shaker</italic> (this paper;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Zagotta et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bezanilla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa  and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>), except for an early model presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al. (1992)</xref>. There is no consensus  between the various models on the voltage dependence  of the final opening transition in wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>,  which reflects the fact that it is difficult to measure such  a fast transition as a separate component in the kinetic  measurements. The ILT mutation makes the final cooperative transition rate limiting, making it possible to  measure the voltage dependence of this transition in  the ILT mutant.</p><p>Is the voltage dependence of the final cooperative  transition in wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> similar to that of ILT? The  results of studies on the V2 mutant, which substitutes a  valine for L382 at the carboxy-terminal border of the  S4, may provide insight into this matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Schoppa et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998b</xref>,c). The V2 mutation causes a large positive shift in the voltage dependence of a component of gating charge of &#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub> and  shifts the probability of channel opening to a much  more positive voltage range than <italic>Shaker</italic>. In these respects, the effect of the V2 mutation is strikingly similar  to that of the ILT mutation. However, in the kinetic  model for <italic>Shaker</italic> and V2 gating developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa  and Sigworth (1998c)</xref>, the voltage-shifted component  of gating charge (1.75 e<sub>0</sub>) is moved in not one but two  sequential concerted transitions preceeding channel  opening, each of which moves &#x0223c;1 e<sub>0</sub>. The primary reason cited for introducing two final cooperative transitions is to explain the features of <italic>Shaker</italic> and V2 OFF  gating currents, which show a rising phase followed by  a slow decay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth (1998c)</xref> found that  one cooperative transition must be introduced to account for the rising phase of the OFF gating currents,  and a second cooperative transition must be introduced to account for the slow decay, which is slower  than the independent intermediate gating transitions.  However, the kinetics of the OFF gating currents, specifically the presence of a rising phase, may be affected  by channels opening under nonconducting conditions  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chen et al., 1997</xref>). The question of the validity of the  rising phase in the OFF gating kinetics of wild-type  <italic>Shaker</italic> could be addressed using the experimental approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Chen et al. (1997)</xref>, whereby OFF gating currents are measured in conducting solutions by stepping  to the reversal potential of the solutions.</p><p>It is not clear how to reconcile our ILT results with  the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth (1998c)</xref>. Their  model is well constrained by measurements of gating  currents, ionic currents, and single-channel currents.  However, the time course of activation of the V2 channel is fast and sigmoidal like <italic>Shaker</italic> and, accordingly,  the final two cooperative transitions for <italic>Shaker</italic> and V2  in the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998c</xref>) are very  fast. As in the case of wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic>, the last cooperative transition in the gating of V2 may be too fast to be  studied independently of other gating transitions. Thus,  it seems plausible that the last cooperative transition  has a similar voltage dependence (&#x0223c;1.8 e<sub>0</sub>) for <italic>Shaker</italic>,  ILT, and V2, and that the disagreement between the  models arises because of the difficulties inherent in  characterizing the last cooperative transition in <italic>Shaker</italic>  and V2.</p><p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref> found  that the I372L substitution, which is one of the three  substitutions made in ILT, is responsible for increasing  the equivalent charge movement associated with the final opening transition. The I372L substitution also  greatly slows the final transition, which allows the properties of the final transition to be determined. Again, it  is possible that the final opening transition in <italic>Shaker</italic>  has the same voltage dependence as in the I372L and  ILT mutants but that the transition is simply too fast to  measure in <italic>Shaker</italic>.</p><p>Alternatively, the I372L mutation may have altered the  amount of equivalent charge moved during the last cooperative gating transition. It is conceivable that charge-conserving mutations could alter the amount of charge  moved during a transition by changing the movement  of the voltage sensor, thereby increasing the fraction of  the electric field through which the charged residues  move or increasing the number of charged residues  that interact with the electric field during the transition  between the final closed state and the open state.</p><p>However, we have found that the amount of charge  moved in this step is not readily altered by mutations  elsewhere in the S4 sequence. The cooperative transition has the same voltage dependence for all three mutant channels studied in this paper, namely ILT, Shaw  S4, and Shaw S4:RRK, despite the fact that these three  mutants have different S4 sequences and produce different effects on earlier steps in the gating pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Channel Structure and Conformational Changes during Activation</title><p>As yet, we do not understand the molecular basis for  structural transitions or cooperativity in <italic>Shaker</italic>. But several aspects of the molecular basis for structural transitions and cooperative interactions are well understood  for a handful of allosteric proteins that have been crystallized in both active and inactive conformations (for  review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Perutz, 1989</xref>). Flexibility of helix packing  seems to be essential for the structural transitions of  many allosteric proteins. &#x003b1;-Helices can shift relative to  each other by up to 1.6 &#x0212b; and turn by several degrees  with only minor adjustments to their side chain packing. When coupled in series, the small shifts of &#x003b1;-helices can be amplified to produce large structural transitions (e.g., for citrates synthase, haemoglobin, and aspartate transcarbamylase).</p><p>The final cooperative transition in <italic>Shaker</italic> gating may  have a similar design, in which a series of small shifts  and turns of many &#x003b1;-helical regions of the protein produce the structural transition that opens or closes the  channel. Consistent with this hypothesis, cysteine-modifying experiments have shown that the process of activation changes the exposure of residues to solution in  many regions of the protein, including the S4 region  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yusaf et al., 1996</xref>), the S4&#x02013;S5  linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>), and the S6 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). This hypothesis is also consistent with the collective findings of a number of mutagenesis studies. In addition to the ILT and V2 mutations, a number of mutations have been identified in  the S4, S4&#x02013;S5 linker, and S5 that affect cooperativity by  increasing the backward rate of the cooperative transition, which manifests itself as an increase in the first  closing rate from the open channel in single channel  recordings. These mutations include R3Q in the carboxy-terminal half of the S4 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Shao and Papazian,  1993</xref>), E395C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>) in the S4-S5  linker region, and F401I in the amino terminal of the  S5 helix (Kanevsky and Aldrich, manuscript submitted  for publication). In the <italic>Shaker</italic> literature, there are  many additional reports of <italic>Shaker</italic> mutations in the S4&#x02013; S6 regions that produce strong effects on gating that  are consistent with changes in cooperativity but for  which the reported data are incomplete or inconclusive  (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Sigworth, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Our knowledge of the structure of <italic>Shaker</italic>, albeit limited, is also consistent with this hypothesis. All of the  transmembrane regions of <italic>Shaker</italic> are predicted to be  &#x003b1;-helical, and experimental evidence is emerging in  support of this prediction. In the three-dimensional  structure of the bacterial channel, the sequences corresponding to the S5 and S6 regions of <italic>Shaker</italic> are &#x003b1;-helical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). Also, evidence from cysteine-scanning mutagenesis suggests that at least part of the  S4&#x02013;S5 linker is &#x003b1;-helical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Holmgren et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>This physical model of gating, in which a series of small  shifts of many &#x003b1;-helices produce a larger structural transition that opens the channel, can explain why even conservative substitutions like ILT and V2 can produce such  strong effects on gating: they may be involved in close-packed contacts between helices that shift during gating.  It can also explain why mutations in different regions of  the protein affect a single conformational change: extensive regions of the protein move during the conformational change that accompanies channel opening.</p><p>The ILT mutant, which isolates the last cooperative  gating transition from earlier gating transitions, may  provide a valuable experimental tool for dissecting out  the molecular basis of structural transitions in the activation of <italic>Shaker</italic>. The ILT channel could be used as a  background for cysteine-scanning mutagenesis experiments in regions that have been shown to change their  exposure during channel opening, like the S4 region  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yusaf et al., 1996</xref>) or the S6 region  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). With this approach, we could correlate the conformational changes of the protein with either the final cooperative step of the gating pathway or  the early charge moving steps.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the S4 in Cooperative Interactions between Subunits</title><p>The molecular basis for cooperativity between subunits  is not understood for <italic>Shaker</italic>, but it is well understood  for a number of allosteric proteins that have been crystallized in active and inactive forms (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Perutz, 1989</xref>). Subunit contacts are of critical importance  for stabilizing the alternative structures of the active  and inactive forms of haemoglobin, phopsphofructokinase, and aspartate transcarbamylase. The contacts between subunits strongly stabilize only the alternative  quaternary structures of the protein and do not stabilize intermediate forms of the protein (e.g., where  some subunits are in a different conformation from the  others). Thus, concerted transitions between alternative quaternary structures of the protein are strongly favored energetically. The contacts between subunits in  alternative structures are stabilized chiefly by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between side  chains of opposite charge.</p><p>The molecular basis of cooperativity in <italic>Shaker</italic> may  have a similar design. The results presented in this paper and Smith-Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1998a</xref>,b) clearly demonstrate that the S4 region is involved in cooperative interactions between subunits, not just in voltage sensing.  Although the involvement of the S4 in cooperativity  may be mediated indirectly, our results point to the intriguing possibility that the S4 helix may form part of  the interface between subunits. If the S4 forms part of  the interface between subunits, then it is possible that  some of the charged residues in the S4 region participate in salt bridges across subunits that stabilize the alternative quaternary structures of the closed and open  <italic>Shaker</italic> channel.</p><p>The evidence in favor of the charges in the S4 region  participating in salt bridges is compelling. Neutralizations at K5 and R6 are &#x0201c;lethal&#x0201d; (prevent proper folding  and expression of channels), but can be rescued by  making complementary neutralizations at E293Q in  the S2 region and D316N in the S3 region, suggesting  that the S4 basic residues K5 and R6 participate in electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) with acidic residues  in the S3 (Papazian et al., 1995). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tiwari-Woodruff et al.  (1997)</xref> have shown that a lethal charge reversal mutation at K5 can be rescued by a second charge reversal  mutation at E293 and that a lethal charge reversal mutation at E283 in the S2 can be rescued by making a second charge reversal mutation at either R3 or R4.</p><p>Although there is strong evidence to suggest that several of the charges in the S4 region participate in salt  bridges, the question of whether these bridges form  within or across subunits has not been as thoroughly investigated. Studies on heteromultimeric channels suggest that the interaction between K5 and E293 is within,  not across, subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tiwari-Woodruff et al., 1997</xref>), but  this result alone does not preclude the possibility that  some of the charges in the S4 region can participate in  salt bridges across subunits.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of S4 sequences for wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> and  mutant channels.
