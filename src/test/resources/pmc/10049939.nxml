Although major histocompatibility complex class II&#x02013;restricted human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells with specific antitumor reactivities have been described, no standard method exists for  cloning the recognized tumor-associated antigen (Ag). In this study, biochemical protein purification methods were used in conjunction with novel mass spectrometry sequencing techniques and molecular cloning to isolate a unique melanoma Ag recognized by a CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) line. The HLA-DR&#x003b2;1*0101&#x02013;restricted Ag was determined to be  a mutated glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). A C to T mutation identified  by cDNA sequencing caused a Thr to Ile conversion in TPI, which could be detected in a  tryptic digest of tumor-derived TPI by mass spectrometry. The Thr to Ile conversion created a  neoepitope whose T cell stimulatory activity was enhanced at least 5 logs compared with the  wild-type peptide. Analysis of T cell recognition of serially truncated peptides suggested that  the mutated amino acid residue was a T cell receptor contact. Defining human tumor Ag recognized by T helper cells may provide important clues to designing more effective immunotherapies for cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>antigen</kwd><kwd>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells</kwd><kwd>HLA-DR1</kwd><kwd>triosephosphate isomerase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>During the past decade, the field of human tumor immunology has evolved from describing interactions  between lymphocytes and tumor cells on a cellular level, to  dissecting mechanisms of tumor-specific immune recognition on a molecular and biochemical level. Attention has  been focused predominantly on tumor-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells, since they exert important antitumor effector functions in many in vivo murine tumor models. Methods have  been developed to identify MHC class I&#x02013;restricted tumor-associated Ag recognized by human CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, through  molecular cloning in stable or transient expression systems  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), or through direct mass spectrometric sequencing of  peptides eluted from tumor-derived MHC&#x02013;peptide complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The availability of these technologies has facilitated a tremendous expansion of our knowledge of commonly expressed as well as mutated tumor-associated Ags  recognized by MHC class I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells derived from cancer patients (for a review, see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).  Such knowledge has in turn led to the development of  experimental Ag-specific immunotherapies, which have  yielded encouraging clinical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, the partial and transient nature of many of the observed clinical responses indicates a need to develop approaches that recruit  additional immunologic effector components.</p><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells play a central role in generating and maintaining immune responses, through interactions with CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cells and B cells, and in their capacity as memory cells.  There is ample evidence from murine tumor models to  suggest an important role for Th cells in regulating CTL-,  macrophage-, eosinophil-, and antibody-dependent pathways of antitumor immunity (for a review, see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).  In humans, tumor-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells have been demonstrated in patients with many different types of cancers  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), and we are just beginning to explore the nature of  the specific Ags which are recognized. However, no standard method exists to facilitate this area of study. The molecular methods used successfully in class I systems are not  directly applicable, due to the complexity of the class II&#x02013; restricted Ag processing pathway with its specialized peptide loading component and requirement for accessory  molecules. Likewise, the peptide elution strategy is also not  readily applied, owing to the necessity for massive quantities  of tumor tissue (&#x0003e;10<sup>11</sup> cells) for study. We have previously  identified tyrosinase as an Ag recognized by melanoma-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from one patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>); however, this was  done in the context of screening candidate Ags already  known to be recognized by melanoma-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new techniques for isolating and characterizing MHC class II&#x02013; restricted tumor Ags. Here, we describe the identification of  an HLA-DR1&#x02013;restricted mutated triosephosphate isomerase  (TPI)<sup>1</sup> epitope recognized by melanoma-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells, using a strategy that combines biochemical purification with mass spectrometric sequencing and molecular  cloning. This approach uses the exogenous route of Ag  processing characteristic of class II systems, for pulsing  components of subcellular compartments as well as sequentially purified tumor-derived protein fractions onto APCs  for T cell recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell Cultures.</title><p>T cell, B cell, and melanoma cell lines were  initiated from specimens derived from patient 1558, a 48-yr-old  Caucasian male who had a primary cutaneous melanoma lesion  resected from the right shoulder 13 yr before the development of  metastatic disease in multiple organ systems. Tumor-infiltrating  lymphocytes (TIL) were cultured from a subcutaneous metastasis  resected from patient 1558 according to methods described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>),  and were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% human AB serum  and recombinant IL-2 (600 IU/ml; Chiron) for up to 120 d  without Ag restimulation. Under these conditions, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  selectively proliferated, reaching &#x0003e;97% after 4 wk of culture, and  manifested specific recognition of autologous tumor cells which  constitutively expressed MHC class II molecules. Melanoma cultures and EBV-transformed B cell lines were established in our  laboratory and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).  To grow large quantities of tumor cells for protein purification,  the 1558-mel line, which was initiated from the same metastatic  lesion used to generate TIL 1558, was maintained in 10-chamber  cell factories (Nunc International). The monocytic leukemia cell  line THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection) was grown in  RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS; before use as APCs, these cells were  cultured in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; 100 U/ml for 48&#x02013;96 h to upregulate expression of MHC class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>HLA Typing.</title><p>HLA serotypes and DNA genotypes of fresh  PBLs and cell lines were determined by the National Institutes of  Health HLA Laboratory, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

The digest was frozen at  &#x02013;35&#x000b0;C until analyzed. An aliquot containing &#x0223c;25 ng of digested  protein was analyzed by nano-HPLC microelectrospray ionization (&#x003bc;ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). All mass spectrometric analyses were performed on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer  (Finnigan). The ESI head supplied with the instrument was  removed and replaced with a &#x003bc;ESI source. The ESI voltage  (1.5&#x02013;1.8 kV) was applied via a stainless steel union placed on the  HPLC pump side of the reversed phase column. The &#x003bc;ESI tips  were made from 360-&#x003bc;m outer diameter (OD), 75-&#x003bc;m inner diameter (ID) fused silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies) pulled  to &#x0223c;20-&#x003bc;m OD, 5-&#x003bc;m ID using a P-2000 laser puller (Sutter  Co.). The &#x003bc;ESI tips were connected directly to a nano-HPLC  column using 350-&#x003bc;m ID Teflon tubing (Zues). Nano-HPLC  columns were prepared by packing &#x0223c;10 cm of 5-&#x003bc;m C18 material (YMC Corp.) inside 360-&#x003bc;m OD, 75-&#x003bc;m ID fused silica  capillary. Solvents A and B for HPLC were 0.1 M acetic acid in  water and 0.1 M acetic acid in 70% acetonitrile. The HPLC gradient increased from 1 to 35% acetonitrile in 11 min. Variable  flow chromatography (Settlage, R.E., R.E. Christian, J. Shabanowitz, and D.F. Hunt, manuscript submitted for publication;  patent pending), technology in which the mass spectrometer data  system controls the rate of sample introduction, was used for the  analysis of the protein digest. Flow rate for mobile phase into the  mass spectrometer was set at &#x0223c;200 nl/min at the beginning of  the gradient, switched to &#x0003c;50 nl/min shortly before peptides began to elute, and returned to 200 nl/min once peptides were no  longer detected. LCQ software programs used in the above experiment included those for data-dependent data acquisition, dynamic exclusion, and isotope exclusion. For data-dependent analysis, the instrument was programmed to continuously cycle  through six scan events. Scan event 1 was an MS scan from 300  to 2,000 m/z. Scan events 2&#x02013;6 were MS/MS scans on the five  most abundant ions detected in scan event 1. The dynamic exclusion settings were as follows: 6 amu &#x0003d; exclusion width; 2 min &#x0003d;  exclusion duration; 30 s &#x0003d; preexclusion duration.

Peptides from  the protein databases are scored and ranked based on the similarity between the experimental and theoretical spectra.

These findings  suggested that the Ag recognized by TIL 1558 was in fact a  neoantigen resulting from a genetic mutation unique to the  autologous melanoma.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Identification of the Specific Tumor Ag Recognized by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  TIL 1558.</title><p>The ability of TIL 1558 to recognize the  1558-mel Ag when processed by APCs through the exogenous MHC class II pathway afforded an opportunity to  apply a protein purification strategy for Ag identification.  Through this approach, melanoma cells could be reduced  to subcellular compartments and then to sequentially purified protein fractions, which could be assayed for bioactivity by feeding them to APCs for T cell recognition. Importantly, since the recognized protein Ag would be processed  into smaller peptide fragments by APCs, it would not be  necessary to preserve tertiary protein structure during the  purification procedure.</p><p>Melanoma cells disrupted by douncing in the presence of  protease inhibitors were separated into nuclear, membrane,  and cytosolic fractions by differential centrifugation. The  cytosol was further fractionated by a stepwise (NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub>  precipitation, and each fraction was pulsed onto APCs for  T cell recognition. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the cytosol provided a much stronger stimulus for melanoma-specific T  cells than the membrane or nuclear fractions, and most of  the cytosolic activity precipitated at 75% (NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub> saturation. This finding was reproduced in two similar experiments. Titration experiments demonstrated that the 75%  (NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4</sub> precipitate recovered from the cytosol was  5&#x02013;25 times more stimulatory than the other fractions  tested, although the protein content of the various fractions  differed only by up to twofold (not shown). None of the  1558-mel fractions were capable of stimulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL  from another patient, and a cytosolic fraction prepared in a  similar manner from a renal cell carcinoma line failed to  stimulate TIL 1558. Thus, TIL 1558 seemed to recognize a  cytosolic (soluble) protein unique to 1558-mel. </p><p>To isolate the 1558-mel Ag, the active cytosolic fraction  was purified through a series of chromatographic separations. First, proteins that precipitated at 75% (NH<sub>4</sub>)2SO<sub>4  </sub>saturation were dissolved in buffer and applied to an anion  exchange column. When individual fractions eluted from  the column were pulsed onto APCs for T cell recognition,  it was found that the bioactivity remained in the column  run-through, and therefore the protein of interest had  failed to bind to the column. However, SDS-PAGE analysis of all of the eluate fractions indicated that, although the  bioactive run-through contained a complex mixture of  proteins, many other proteins which lacked bioactivity  had bound and separated adequately on the column (not  shown); thus, a significant purification of the specific tumor  Ag had been achieved. Next, the bioactive material recovered after anion exchange chromatography was separated  according to molecular size on a gel filtration column. The  results of testing individual fractions for T cell recognition  are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, demonstrating a peak of bioactivity in  eluate fractions 20&#x02013;23, with GM-CSF secretion by TIL in  response to fraction 21 reaching 371-fold above background secretion (29,300 compared with 79 pg/ml). Although a significant purification was achieved at this step,  SDS-PAGE indicated that the bioactive fractions still contained a complex mixture of proteins. The final chromatographic purification was performed by combining the bioactive gel filtration fractions and applying them to a  hydrophobic interaction column. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows that this  procedure yielded two highly bioactive fractions, numbers 4  and 6. Each appeared to contain a single protein band of  &#x0223c;30 kD on SDS-PAGE.  </p><p>Fraction 6, which was eluted from the hydrophobic  interaction column, was subjected to tryptic cleavage followed by nano-HPLC &#x003bc;ESI ion trap MS. Using data- dependent data acquisition, dynamic exclusion, isotope  exclusion, and SEQUEST database searching, 19 peptide  sequences were obtained, representing a total of 187 amino  acids, and all were identified as nonmutated human TPI. In  addition, eluate fraction 4 was subjected to NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal  sequencing with Edman degradation, yielding an 11&#x02013;amino  acid sequence corresponding to residues 2&#x02013;12 of TPI. No  other proteins were identified in these fractions. The complete TPI sequence (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="M10036">M10036</ext-link>) contains 249 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of  26,700 daltons, corresponding to the observed mass of the  1558-mel Ag on SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Characterization of the Mutated TPI Epitope Recognized by  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL 1558.</title><p>To confirm that TPI was indeed the  tumor-specific Ag recognized by TIL 1558, cDNA encoding TPI was amplified from mRNA derived from 1558-mel, the cell line which stimulated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL, as well as  from the autologous B cell line 1558-EBV, which did not  stimulate TIL. TPI was cloned into a eukaryotic expression  vector, and recombinant plasmids derived from individual  bacterial colonies were transiently transfected into COS-7  cells. COS transfectants expressing TPI protein were then  pulsed onto APCs as freeze&#x02013;thaw lysates, for T cell recognition.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> shows the results of testing individual TPI clones  derived from 1558-mel for T cell recognition. TPI encoded by three clones (designated 1B, 5B, and 11G) stimulated T cells, as manifested by GM-CSF secretion, while  three other TPI clones were not stimulatory, nor was a  &#x003b2;-actin clone used as a negative control. Western blotting  with the anti-FLAG mAb, directed against a specific 8-mer  sequence fused to the COOH terminus of each of these  proteins, confirmed that all recombinant proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells at comparable levels (not shown).  DNA sequencing demonstrated that the three TPI clones  encoding a product recognized by T cells shared a missense  mutation at nucleotide position 450, consisting of a C to T  substitution. The effect of this mutation was to convert the  wild-type threonine (A<underline>C</underline>T) at amino acid position 28 to an  isoleucine (A<underline>T</underline>T). TPI clones 4B, 12A, and 12F, also derived from 1558-mel, did not contain this mutation and  were not recognized by T cells. As an incidental finding, all  six TPI clones derived from 1558-mel shared two silent  nucleotide substitutions, at positions 652 (A to G) and 856  (C to G), presumed to represent DNA polymorphisms.  Thus, the six TPI clones obtained from 1558-mel represented two alleles, one wild-type, the other containing a  unique mutation. The nucleotide substitution at position  450 was not identified in six clones derived from 1558-EBV, suggesting that this was indeed a somatic mutation  which had occurred in the tumor, and not an allelic polymorph. </p><p>To confirm that the mutated TPI protein predicted by  DNA sequencing was in fact present in 1558-mel cells, a  novel mass spectrometric sequence analysis computer program was applied, which generated &#x0223c;5,000 mutant TPI sequences that differed from the wild-type sequence by a single amino acid. The MS/MS data from the TPI digest was  then searched against the 5,000 mutant TPI sequences using SEQUEST programmed with the same settings as described in Materials and Methods. This experiment detected a new tryptic peptide corresponding to TPI residues  20&#x02013;33, in which Thr at position 28 was substituted with either Ile or Leu. No other mutant peptides were detected in  this analysis.</p><p>To further investigate the effect of the TPI mutation on  T cell reactivity, peptides encompassing the site of mutation were synthesized and assessed for recognition by TIL  1558. A wild-type 15-mer peptide, TPI 23&#x02013;37, was synthesized with the sequence GELIGTLNAAKVPAD, as  well as a mutant peptide containing Ile instead of Thr at  position 28 (TPI<sub>mut</sub>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, T cell recognition  of the mutated peptide was enhanced at least 5 logs compared with the wild-type. Also of note, subnanomolar concentrations of the mutant peptide were recognized consistently, reminiscent of the extremely sensitive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell  responses typically observed against foreign microbial epitopes. This is in contrast to the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell recognition of  nonmutated melanoma-associated tyrosinase epitopes described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), which required peptide concentrations of 10 &#x003bc;M or more for half-maximal stimulation. </p><p>Finally, we wished to determine the immunologic function of the TPI mutation; that is, whether the mutated  amino acid constituted an MHC-binding residue or a TCR  contact. A substantial amount of information is available  concerning the binding motif of peptides complexed to  HLA-DR&#x003b2;1*0101, which is the restriction element for  TPI<sub>mut </sub>23&#x02013;37 as demonstrated by mAb blocking studies and  peptide presentation by allogeneic HLA-compatible APCs  (not shown). The crystal structure of this HLA molecule  complexed to a high-affinity peptide, influenza HA 306&#x02013; 318, reveals that the peptide binding site has one large hydrophobic pocket accommodating the P1 peptide anchor  residue, which is the major determinant of peptide binding  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The crystal structure of HLA-DR&#x003b2;1*0101 also demonstrates shallower, less hydrophobic pockets accommodating the P4, P6, P7, and P9 peptide anchor residues. Inspection of the sequences of peptides naturally binding to this  MHC allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), as well as monitoring the effects of substituted analogues and truncated peptides on MHC binding  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), have confirmed the overriding importance of the hydrophobic P1 anchor and lesser roles for the other four anchor residues. In the case of the TPI<sub>mut </sub>23&#x02013;37 peptide, potential P1 anchors include the hydrophobic residues Leu 25  and Ile 26, and the mutation itself, Ile 28. A series of truncated peptides were tested for T cell recognition, and as  shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>, Leu 25 was unimportant whereas Ile 26  was required for stimulating CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL 1558. If Ile 26  were indeed the P1 anchor, then Val 34 would be the P9  anchor, and serial truncations at the COOH terminus of  TPI<sub>mut</sub> 23&#x02013;37 confirmed that peptides lacking the Val 34 residue were not recognized. These data identify the 9&#x02013;amino  acid MHC binding core of the mutated TPI epitope as extending from Ile 26 to Val 34, and suggest that the site of  mutation, Ile 28, is a TCR contact, as it resides in the P3  position. For peptides binding to HLA-DR&#x003b2;1*0101, the  role of the P3 residue as a TCR contact has been shown by  crystal structure as well as by studies of substituted synthetic  analogues which competitively inhibit TCR engagement  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study describes the isolation and characterization  of a mutated MHC class II&#x02013;restricted human tumor Ag  through a multimodality approach that combines biochemical fractionation, mass spectrometric sequencing, and molecular cloning. Monach et al. have used a similar strategy  to identify a class II&#x02013;restricted murine tumor Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>); to  our knowledge, this report is the first successful human application. This approach to Ag identification is uniquely  suited to class II systems, in which Ag pulsed exogenously  onto APCs can access the endosomal processing compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Since the end-point bioassay measures the presence of a processed peptide rather than an intact protein,  the biochemical purification procedures need not preserve  native tertiary structure. This represents a convenient advantage relative to traditional applications of similar protein  purification schemes, such as those used in enzymology.  Another innovation is the use of MS to sequence the purified protein. The combination of HPLC and ion trap MS  has made it possible to sequence peptides at the 20&#x02013;50 amol  level. This technique is particularly well suited for sequencing proteins in complex mixtures and for characterizing  posttranslational modifications. These features render mass  spectrometric sequencing eminently suited for situations in  which limited quantities of material are available, and for  subtractive approaches comparing the constituents of two  or more partially purified protein fractions with known  bioactivities.</p><p>The protein containing the mutation recognized by  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL 1558, TPI (EC 5.3.1.1), is an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a critical step for generating energy in the glycolytic pathway. Its sequence is highly  conserved among species, with &#x0223c;50% amino acid homology between <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and humans, and human TPI is considered to have evolved into a &#x0201c;perfect enzyme,&#x0201d; with one of  the highest catalytic rates known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). TPI is found among  the dozen or so predominant proteins in two-dimensional  gel databases generated from human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), which  is not surprising in view of its energy-generating function  as well as its link to nucleotide synthesis via the pentose  phosphate shunt. Studies of thousands of individuals have  failed to detect allelic variants of TPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). The several described mutant forms of the enzyme are all linked to human deficiency diseases; mutations at nucleotide position  450, associated with 1558-mel, have not been reported.  However, there is evidence for a causal relationship between UV irradiation, an agent implicated in generating  melanomas in vivo, and C to T nucleotide substitutions  such as occurred in 1558-mel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Indeed, C to T mutations have been shown to generate MHC class I&#x02013;restricted  neoantigens recognized by CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from two melanoma patients. In those two instances, functional mutations  in cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) may  have conferred an oncogenic advantage on the tumor cells,  which could have counterbalanced or outweighed the negative effect of disclosing the tumor to immune recognition.  The crystal structure of TPI indicates that Thr 28, the site  of the 1558-mel mutation, is not located at an active catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>); in fact, deliberate attempts to enhance the  function of TPI through site-directed mutagenesis of catalytic site residues have not been successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). However,  one might speculate that the nonconservative Thr28Ile  mutation could impact on the tertiary structure of the enzyme and hence its catalytic function, and the potential role  of this mutation in enhancing TPI function will be explored in future studies.</p><p>By immunohistochemical analysis, the subcutaneous melanoma metastasis from which TIL 1558 were derived expressed the shared immunogenic melanoma-associated proteins tyrosinase, gp100, and melanoma antigen recognized  by T cells (MART)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Nevertheless, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL 1558  failed to react against these commonly expressed, nonmutated Ags, instead responding to a unique neoantigen.  These TIL are representative of the majority of MHC class  II&#x02013;restricted melanoma-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells analyzed  from nine patients, among which two recognized the commonly expressed nonmutated tyrosinase Ag, while the rest  reacted against unique tumor-specific Ag (8, 10, 36, and  our unpublished data). The apparent dichotomy between  melanoma Ag recognized by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> versus CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  (unique versus shared Ag) may reflect events occurring  during T cell development, with selective deletion of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  but not CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells reactive with lineage-specific &#x0201c;self&#x0201d;  Ag expressed in melanomas. Since melanocytes do not normally reside in the thymus during development, their Ags  would be represented there by migrating APCs which had  ingested and processed these Ags, preferentially leading to  presentation on MHC class II molecules and deletion of class  II&#x02013;restricted Th cells. Thus, while it is important to identify shared tumor-associated Ags recognized by both CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells for devising more effective immunotherapies, it is also necessary to define optimally potent Ags  which can mediate tumor rejection. These may not be one  and the same, and immunotherapies incorporating unique  neoantigens may be required to realize the full potential of  this treatment modality.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Melanoma-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TIL 1558 are HLA-DR restricted.
