A critical issue is whether unmutated tumor antigens  are expressed in normal cells, and if so, whether such expression imposes special restrictions on  cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. In this study, we use a transgenic approach to study  the development and effector function of T cells specific for P1A, a prototypical unmutated tumor antigen. We report here that although P1A is expressed at low levels in normal tissues, including lymphoid tissues, the P1A-specific transgenic T cells develop normally and remain  highly responsive to the P1A antigen. The fact that transgenic expression of P1A antigen in the  thymus induces T cell clonal deletion demonstrates that normal hematopoietic cells can process  and present the P1A antigen and that P1A-specific T cells are susceptible to clonal deletion. By  inference, P1A-specific T cells must have escaped clonal deletion due to low expression of P1A  in the thymus. Interestingly, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of T cells in the T  cell receptor for antigen (TCR)&#x02013;transgenic mice are specific for P1A, these mice are no more  resistant to a P1A-expressing plasmocytoma than nontransgenic littermates. Moreover, when  the same TCR-transgenic mice were challenged simultaneously with B7-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and B7-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors, only B7-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumors were rejected. Therefore, even though P1A can be a tumor rejection  antigen, the effector function of P1A-specific CTL is restrained in vivo. These results have important implications for the strategy of tumor immunotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytotoxic &#x02009;T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>unmutated tumor antigen</kwd><kwd>T cell development</kwd><kwd>antitumor immunity</kwd><kwd>T cell receptor&#x02013;transgenic mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Afundamental question in tumor immunology is how  tumor antigens induce T cell responses. Even though  the existence of tumor antigens recognized by syngeneic T  cells has been well demonstrated (reviewed in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>),  the fundamental issue of whether these antigens are recognized as self antigen or foreign antigen remains unresolved  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Tumor antigens can be divided into two major categories: those that are mutated products of normal genes (4&#x02013; 10) and those that bear no mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). With the  notable exception of mutations in several oncogenes that  are directly responsible for tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is anticipated that the mutated tumor antigens are usually  unique for individual tumors. Expression of unmutated tumor antigens, on the other hand, has been demonstrated in  multiple tumors of the same lineage and among tumors of  multiple lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It has been suggested that  this category of tumor antigens may offer valuable targets  for tumor vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The basic knowledge of vaccination is derived from our  experience with infectious agents, i.e., foreign antigens  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). However, tumor antigens, particularly unmutated tumor antigens, are not necessarily foreign to the immune  system. Of the unmutated tumor antigens identified so far,  genes encoding some of them, such as tyrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and  Pmel 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), are expressed in normal tissues. Other genes,  such as those for P1A in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and the MAGE and  GAGE families in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), are reportedly expressed only on tumors or perhaps in immunologically  privileged sites such as testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have evolved to ensure self&#x02013;nonself discrimination of T cells. T cells specific for self antigen  in the thymus are deleted or rendered anergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In  the periphery, tissue-specific antigens can also inactivate T  cells by either one of these mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). It has  been documented that genes encoding a substantial number  of unmutated tumor antigens are expressed in normal cells,  but the immunological consequences have not been systematically analyzed. Two issues are particularly relevant.  First, If vaccines based on unmutated antigens induce  strong immunity, would such immune responses cause autoimmune disease? Although immunotherapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes specific for gp100 and vaccination  with GM&#x02013;CSF-transduced renal carcinoma induced immune reaction to normal tissues, neither procedure resulted  in severe autoimmune disease (2, 32, and 33). Immunization with unmutated tumor antigen P1A, which is expressed in murine testis, does affect fertility in male mice  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Second, as self-reactive T cells are controlled at multiple checkpoints during the development, induction, and  effector phase of T cell responses, it is of interest to determine if immune responses to unmutated tumor antigens are  restrained at any of these checkpoints.</p><p>P1A was the first unmutated tumor antigen to be identified. Although it was originally described in mastocytoma  cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), it was later observed that P1A is expressed in  testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), but expression in other tissues was not reported.  Using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR),<sup>1</sup> we observed  that P1A is expressed at low but significant levels in normal tissue including hematopoietic tissues. To determine  whether unmutated tumor antigens can influence the development, induction, and effector function of antigen-specific T cells, we produced two types of transgenic mice:  one that expresses the T cell receptor from a CTL clone  that recognizes P1A, and another that overexpresses the tumor antigen P1A in hematopoietic tissues. These mouse  models allowed us to monitor the effect of endogenous expression of tumor antigen on the development, induction,  and effector function of T cells specific for an unmutated  tumor antigen. Analysis of P1A-reactive T cells indicates  that endogenous P1A antigen does not interfere with the  development of P1A-specific T cells. Interestingly, the  TCR-transgenic mice are no more resistant than their littermates to plasmacytoma J558. Moreover, even though  immunization with P1A peptide induces an anti-P1A CTL  response, it does not induce protection against P1A- expressing tumors. Thus, although P1A-specific CTL develop normally, their effector function is restrained in vivo.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Experimental Animals and Cell Lines.</title><p>BALB/cByJ, CByD2F1,  C3H/J, and C57BL/6j mice were purchased from The <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="jackson">Jackson  Laboratory</named-content>.

The P1A primers used should amplify a 500-bp  product from properly spliced P1A RNA. PCR product from  genomic DNA should be 3.1 kb. The size of amplifed GAPDH  cDNA should be 900 bp.

We used  the restriction sites at the end of the amplified fragment to clone  it into the E<sub>&#x003bc;</sub>mb&#x02013;Id2 vector, a gift from Dr. Xiao-Hong Sun  (New York University Medical Center, New York) which contains the IgM heavy chain enhancer (E<sub>&#x003bc;</sub>), the <italic>mb-1</italic>-promoter, an intron from the small T antigen gene, and an SV40 polyadenylation  signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

Using published  primer sequences, we found that P1CTL express only V&#x003b2;1, a 10-bp  D segment, J&#x003b2;2, and C&#x003b2;1.

Northern blot analysis did not reproducibly  detect significant levels of P1A RNA expression in most  tissues except in the testis (data not shown), which is consistent with an earlier study by Uyttenhove et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). We  therefore used the more sensitive method of RT-PCR to  detect the expression of P1A RNA. The PCR products  were detected by Southern blot using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes.  This procedure not only ensured the identity of the products amplified but also enhanced the sensitivity of the assay.  The forward and reverse primers are in separate exons, and  the products amplified from genomic DNA should be 3.1 kb,  whereas those amplified from mRNA should be 500 bp. As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a, a significant amount of P1A RNA was  detected in most tissues by RT-PCR. The mRNA level  was highest in the testis as has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Lung and  spleen tissues expressed more P1A RNA than liver tissue.  Although P1A RNA can be detected in the thymus in  some experiments, its thymic level was always at least 10-fold lower than in the spleen (data not shown). To compare the levels of P1A mRNA in spleen and tumor cells,  we titrated the amount of cDNA prepared from either  spleen or J558 tumor cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b, the relative abundance of the P1A cDNA in the spleen was &#x0223c;100&#x02013; 1,000-fold lower than levels found in the tumor cells. </p><p>We used a P1A:L<sup>d</sup>-specific CTL line, P1CTL, to determine if the P1A35&#x02013;43:L<sup>d</sup> epitope is presented on the normal  lymphoid cells. The P1CTL was generated after immunization with P815 cells and has been restimulated in vitro for  almost two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). All cells in the P1CTL line express the  V&#x003b1;8 chain on cell surface (data not shown). As shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> a, P1A-specific CTL failed to kill syngeneic spleen cells  that had been activated by either LPS, Con A, or anti-CD3  mAb. As a result we failed to detect P1A antigenic epitope  on activated T and B cells by CTL assay. However, since direct cytolysis requires antigen expression on a substantial proportion of target cells, this assay cannot rule out the possibility that a small proportion of cells may express the antigen. </p><p>We have recently produced transgenic mice that express  the TCR from P1CTL. We therefore used proliferation assay to determine if antigen-presenting spleen cells from syngeneic mice can induce activation of P1A-specific T cells. As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b, unstimulated spleen APC failed to induce  proliferation of transgenic T cells. However, after stimulation with LPS, weak but significant proliferation of transgenic T cells could be detected. Thus, activated APC can  present P1A epitope. The relatively weak proliferation could  be due to either low frequency of APC that present P1A  epitope or a low level of P1A epitope expression on all APC.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Normal Development and Induction of P1A-specific CTL.</title><p>Given the fact that the P1A gene is expressed in hematopoietic cells, it is possible that endogenous expression of the  P1A gene may cause either clonal deletion or clonal anergy  of T cells. To analyze the development of P1A-specific T  cells, we cloned the T cell receptor from a P1A-specific  CTL line, P1A CTL. Using the cassette vector provided by  Kouskoff et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), we produced mice with integration of  both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains. Five independent founders were obtained that have cointegration of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; chains, three of  which are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a. After breeding with BALB/c  mice, all F1 mice that carried the transgenes expressed V&#x003b1;  chain on the surface of &#x0003e;50% of PBL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b). Lacking a  mAb specific for V&#x003b2;1, we were unable to directly measure  expression of the &#x003b2; chain; however, expression of the &#x003b2;  chains to which mAbs are available has been excluded, presumably due to transgenic expression of V&#x003b2;1 (data not  shown). To determine whether endogenous expression of  P1A impairs development of P1A-specific T cells, we analyzed the cellular composition of T cells in the thymus. As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> c, the transgenic mice contain a large proportion of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells. A  skewing toward CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subset is consistent with the  fact that transgenic TCR is restricted by MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Moreover, essentially all CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells in the  thymus express a high level of V&#x003b1;8 on the surface. These  results demonstrate that P1A-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are not  subject to clonal deletion in normal mice. </p><p>To test whether endogenous P1A chronically stimulates  P1A-specific T cells, we measured expression of L-selectin  on T cells from the TCR-transgenic mice. L-selectin is expressed at a high level in naive T cells and is downregulated  upon T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Because antigen-experienced T cells remain L-selectin<sup>low</sup> for a long period, this  phenotype has been used as a marker for antigenic exposure of T cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> d, spleen CD8 T cells  that expressed the transgenic &#x003b1; chain are of L-selectin<sup>high</sup>  phenotype. In contrast, in the same spleen, a substantial  proportion of V&#x003b1;8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8 T cells is of L-selectin<sup>low</sup> phenotype. These results demonstrated that the transgenic T cells  were not activated by the endogenous P1A antigen. This  conclusion is consistent with the fact that in vitro syngeneic  APC cannot stimulate transgenic T cells without LPS activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b).</p><p>To test whether the P1A-specific T cells are anergic, we  stimulated the spleen cells from P1A-transgenic mice and  their littermate controls with either P1A peptide or a control peptide from influenza virus. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> a,  spleen cells from P1A-transgenic mice mounted a vigorous,  proliferative response to a low dose of P1A peptide. Maximal proliferation of T cells occurred with a dose of 10 ng/ml  of peptide, indicating that the transgenic TCR must have  high avidity for the tumor antigens. Moreover, after in  vitro restimulation, transgenic T cells exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against P1A-expressing plasmacytoma (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> b). Interestingly, B7-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor cells are more susceptible  than their B7-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts, which is consistent with  our previous observation of ex vivo, P1A-reactive CTL  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Since J558-B7 and J558-Neo expressed comparable  amounts of MHC class I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and P1A antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), it is  likely that after 4 d of in vitro stimulation, the effector  function of transgenic T cells is dependent on B7 presence  on the target cells. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Clonal Deletion of P1A-specific T Cells in Transgenic Mice  Overexpressing P1A Gene in the Thymus.</title><p>The lack of clonal  deletion and anergy of P1A-specific T cells is most likely  due to low expression of the P1A gene in hematopoietic  cells. We produced transgenic mice in which the expression of the P1A gene is under the control of mb-1 promoter and E&#x003bc; enhancer. We prepared cDNA from total  thymic RNA and compared the amount of P1A mRNA in  normal versus transgenic thymus by titration of cDNA.  P1A mRNA was detectable in the thymi of transgenic  mice after the cDNA reached 1:270 dilution, whereas 1:10  dilution of cDNA from nontransgenic littermates failed to  yield any P1A product. Thus, P1A transgenic mice significantly overexpressed P1A. In fact, the levels of P1A  mRNA in transgenic mice are comparable to those in J558  tumor cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a). </p><p>We bred the TCR-transgenic mouse (TG) with the  P1A-TG to generate TCR/P1A&#x02013;TG and analyzed the cell  numbers and cell surface markers of TCR-TG and TCR/ P1A-TG thymi (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b). The total number of TCR/ P1A&#x02013;TG thymocytes was &#x0223c;40% of that of TCR-TG (data  not shown). In addition, a discrete population of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells in the TCR&#x02013;TG is replaced by a population  of cells that has downregulated both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors. This progressive downregulation of CD8 receptors  is more obvious among the thymocytes that have expressed  the highest level of transgenic TCR. Moreover, the relative number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is greatly reduced, and,  as a result, an increase in the percentage of CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T  cells is observed. These results demonstrate that P1A-specific T cells are being deleted in the TCR/P1A&#x02013;TG. Consequently, the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>V&#x003b1;8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are reduced by &#x0003e;80% in  the TCR/P1A&#x02013;TG compared to TCR-TG. Thus, transgenic T cells specific for unmutated tumor antigen are susceptible to clonal deletion in the thymus. Under normal  circumstances, these T cells must have escaped clonal deletion because of low or no P1A expression in the thymus.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>The Effector Function of P1A-specific CTL Is Restrained In  Vivo.</title><p>To test whether the transgenic, P1A-specific cytotoxic T cells can efficiently reject the J558 tumor cells, we  bred the transgenic founder mice with BALB/cByJ for  three generations and tested the tumorigenicity of B7-transfected (J558-B7) or vector-transfected (J558-Neo) tumor cells in the N2 mice. Since all N2 mice carry at least  one copy of the BALB/c genes, minor histoincompatibility  should not cause tumor rejection. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of the T cells  in the transgenic mice express the P1A-specific T cell receptor, TCR-TG<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice were no more resistant to the  plasmacytoma than their TCR-TG<sup>&#x02212;</sup> littermates. The rejection of J558-B7 is mediated by T cells, as J558-B7 and  J558-Neo gave similar tumor onset (not shown) and incidences (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>) in nu/nu mice. </p><p>As the J558-Neo tumor lacks costimulatory activity that  is essential for T cell activation, it is possible that lack of tumor rejection is due to poor activation of the cytotoxic T  cells in vivo. To rule out this possibility, we injected J558-B7 in the right inguens and J558-Neo in the left inguens of  the same mice and monitored the tumor incidence. As  shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>, most of the mice that rejected J558-B7  tumors developed J558-Neo tumors. Both incidence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>) and growth kinetics (data not shown) of the J558-Neo tumor were unaffected by the J558-B7 injected into  the same mice. Thus, the failure of the TCR-TG mice to  reject J558-Neo tumors cannot be attributed to a lack of T  cell activation in vivo, and the results presented in this section indicate that the effector function of the transgenic T  cell is restrained in vivo. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Successful identification of tumor antigens marks the first  important step toward the development of tumor vaccines.  However, much of our current understanding of vaccination is based on experience with infectious agents that are  immunologically distinct from self antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Even  though such knowledge may be directly applicable to mutated tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) that are, by definition, nonself,  a major issue is whether such approaches can be directly  applicable to unmutated antigens, many of which may turn  out to be self antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). To address this important  issue, we used P1A as a model tumor antigen and took a  transgenic approach to study the development and effector  function of P1A-specific T cells. We have made two major  observations. First, endogenous expression of tumor antigen does not interfere with the development and induction  of P1A-specific CTL. P1A was the first unmutated tumor  antigen to be identified. Although it was originally described as expressed only in mastocytoma, later studies indicated that it is expressed in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and in other lineages  of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Here we used RT-PCR and were able to  reproducibly detect P1A mRNA in normal tissues, including hematopoietic tissues. Two earlier studies based on  Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR analysis of P1A RNA  have concluded that in tissues other than testis, the level of  P1A mRNA is &#x0003c;1% of that in P815 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Our finding  that P1A RNA in the spleen is &#x0223c;100-fold lower than that  of J558 tumor cells does not contradict findings in earlier reports. Moreover, though resting APC fail to activate P1A-specific T cells, significant proliferation of transgenic T cells  is induced by activated syngeneic APC. Nevertheless, P1A  is unlikely to be expressed on a large proportion of spleen  cells. If so, it would have been detected by CTL assay using  anti-P1A CTL, which generally requires less ligand but a  wider distribution of antigen among the target population  than is required for proliferation or IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Given the expression of the unmutated tumor antigen in  normal tissues, it is possible that a T cell repertoire specific  for such unmutated tumor antigens may have been selected  so that the high affinity TCR are eliminated as in the case  of T cells for some self antigens such as myelin basic protein  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Although this is an attractive hypothesis, clonal deletion of T cells specific for unmutated tumor antigens has  not been directly addressed due to lack of an experimental  model. To our knowledge, this is the first report that has  evaluated clonal deletion of a transgenic TCR specific for a  natural tumor antigen. Our data clearly demonstrate that  despite expression in normal tissues, P1A product does  not induce clonal deletion of P1A-specific T cells. Since  the transgenic T cells require &#x0003c;10 ng/ml of P1A peptide  for maximal proliferation, it is likely that the TCR&#x02013;L<sup>d</sup>/ P1A35&#x02013;43 interaction is of high avidity. It follows that endogenous P1A epitope does not cause clonal deletion of T  cells with high avidity for P1A:L<sup>d</sup> complex, in contrast to  the epitope on myelin basic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Our conclusion is  supported by the fact that P1A-specific CTL clones characterized by other researchers also have high avidity for the  peptide&#x02013;L<sup>d</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Our results suggest that TCR  with high affinity for unmutated tumor antigen are not  eliminated from the T cell repertoire.</p><p>The transgenic T cells maintain a naive phenotype for  &#x0003e;6 mo (the age at which mice were killed for the study),  although a substantial proportion of T cells utilizing endogenous &#x003b1; chain have experienced antigenic stimulation from  the environment during the same period. It is therefore  most likely that the P1A epitope is essentially ignored by T  cells under physiological conditions. In this regard, it should  be emphasized that although P1A mRNA is detected in normal tissue, we have not analyzed expression of P1A protein  in these tissues due to lack of reagents. The P1A epitope is  detected on the spleen cells only after LPS activation.</p><p>Clonal deletion requires less TCR ligand than T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Lack of a discernible effect of endogenous  P1A on the development of P1A-specific T cells strengthens the conclusion that endogenous P1A epitope is not  present in significant amounts, particularly in the thymus.</p><p>Our second major observation was that the effector  function of P1A-reactive CTL is restrained in vivo. Four  lines of evidence strongly suggest that P1A can be a tumor  rejection antigen. First, classic studies by Uyttenhove et al.  reported that tumor cells that escaped immunity induced  by the tum<sup>&#x02212;</sup>P815 had lost P1A antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Second, immunization with P1A cDNA induces protection against  subsequent challenge of P815 cells, although the authors  noticed that the correlation between the strength of the recall CTL response in vitro and the anti-tumor immunity  was poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Third, adoptive transfer of P1A-specific  CTL line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) or polyclonal CTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) protects against subsequent challenge of P815 cells. Fourth, in mice challenged  with P815 tumor, a strong correlation was observed between expansion of recurrent TCR repertoire and tumor  rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Thus, although there is a strong case that  P1A can induce immunity against tumors that express the  antigen, it is less clear whether P1A-specific CTL generated in vivo are responsible for tumor rejection.</p><p>It is intriguing that active immunization with P1A, either by adenoviruses engineered to express P1A in vivo  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) or by P1A peptide (our unpublished results) which induces anti-P1A CTL, does not confer immunity against  P1A-expressing tumors. In addition, we have previously  demonstrated that multiple lineages of tumors that share  the P1A antigen are not crossprotected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A critical issue  is whether the poor CTL-mediated protection is due to insufficient clonal expansion of P1A-specific CD8 T cells or  to diminished effector function of these T cells. To address  this issue, we have produced transgenic mice in which the  overwhelming majority of CD8 T cells are specific for  P1A. We report here that unless B7-1 is present on the tumor cells, no immunity is conferred by the cytotoxic T  cells. Moreover, when the same transgenic mouse is injected with both B7-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and B7-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors, B7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumors are  rejected but B7-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors grow progressively. Our finding  supports and extends findings by Wick et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), who  have recently reported that a tumor expressing an alloantigen was not rejected in mice that carry transgenic T cells  specific for the antigen, although the same mice could reject skin grafts with the same alloantigen. Even though  both studies highlight a restrained T cell effector function,  our study emphasized that such restriction can be overcome by expressing B7-1 on the tumor cells.</p><p>Theoretically, at least four mechanisms can be proposed  to account for the apparent restraint of the effector function of P1A-specific CTL. First, T cells specific for unmutated tumor antigen may be of intrinsically low affinity because high affinity P1A-reactive CTL may have been  deleted due to endogenous expression of the tumor antigen. We show here that the high avidity, P1A-specific T  cells were not deleted, unless P1A is overexpressed in the  thymus as a transgene, which would rule out this possibility. Second, endogenous P1A may have rendered P1A- reactive T cells anergic. This is also unlikely, as we have  shown that transgenic P1A-reactive T cells remain fully responsive to low concentrations of P1A and exhibit strong  cytotoxicity against P1A-expressing tumors after in vitro  stimulation. Third, it is possible that endogenous P1A has  prevented full maturation of P1A-reactive CTL. The fact  that fully active, P1A-specific CTL generated in vitro can  be therapeutic in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) and that the effector function of ex vivo tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes recovered  from P1A-expressing tumors requires B7 on target cells for  optimal cytolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) support this contention. Fourth, we  have recently demonstrated that anti-tumor CD8 T cells  do not exhibit cytotoxicity until after they have reached  the tumor site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). The requirement of B7-1 for tumor rejection in the transgenic mice can also be explained in part  by the need for local activation of anti-tumor CTL.</p><p>Since tissue destruction by some autoreactive transgenic  T cells also requires expression of B7 in the target tissues  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>), it is tempting to suggest that endogenous expression of unmutated tumor antigen may contribute to the restrained effector function of transgenic T cells. This concept can be formally tested when mice lacking endogenous  P1A are generated.</p><p>In summary, we have used a transgenic model to study  the development, induction, and effector function of P1A-specific CTL. Our results demonstrate that the endogenous  P1A antigen does not cause clonal deletion of high avidity,  P1A-specific T cells in vivo. Even though P1A may well  be a tumor rejection antigen, the effector function of P1A-specific T cells is restrained. Since P1A is the prototype of  unmutated tumor antigen, the findings presented here have  important implications: although this type of unmutated  antigen can be used as a target for tumor vaccines and tumor immunotherapy, more emphasis must be placed on  the strategy to induce full activation of T cells to achieve  optimal effector function.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression of unmutated tumor antigen.
