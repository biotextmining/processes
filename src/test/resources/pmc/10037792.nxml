Instead, these organelles are  derived from preexisting mitochondria and specific cellular mechanisms act to ensure the faithful transmission of  mitochondria to progeny. The molecular details of the inheritance process are largely unknown, but a growing list  of key protein components is emerging from analysis of  conditional mutants of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces  cerevisiae</italic> that are defective for mitochondrial distribution  and morphology mutant (<italic>mdm</italic>)<sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Berger and Yaffe, 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hermann and Shaw, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, most characterized <italic>MDM</italic> gene products have  fallen into two basic categories. The first consists of cytoplasmic or cytoskeletal components such as: Mdm1p, an  intermediate filament-like protein required for both mitochondrial and nuclear inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">McConnell and Yaffe,  1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1993</xref>); and Mdm20p, a protein of unknown function  that is important for the structure of the actin cytoskeleton  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Hermann et al., 1997</xref>). The second category consists of  proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane: Mdm10p,  Mdm12p, and Mmm1p. These proteins play roles both in  maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and mediating mitochondrial inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Sogo  and Yaffe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berger et al., 1997</xref>).

This screen involved crossing a haploid strain harboring  the temperature-sensitive <italic>mdm13</italic> lesion to a collection of  temperature-sensitive strains and analyzing growth of  the resulting diploids at the nonpermissive temperature  (37&#x000b0;C). One diploid strain displayed temperature-sensitive  growth, and analysis of its meiotic progeny indicated that  one of two mutations conferring temperature-sensitive  growth mapped to a genetic locus unlinked to <italic>mdm13.</italic>  Therefore, rather than being an allele of <italic>mdm13</italic>, the new  mutation defined a distinct gene. Analysis of cells harboring only the new mutation (after its genetic isolation from  <italic>mdm13</italic>) by staining with the mitochondria-specific, vital  dye DASPMI and fluorescence microscopy revealed defects in mitochondrial distribution and morphology after  incubation at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).  Complementation and allelism tests indicated that the new  mutation was unlinked to previously characterized <italic>mdm</italic>  mutations. Genetic analysis further demonstrated that the  defects in growth at 37&#x000b0;C, mitochondrial distribution, and  mitochondrial morphology were caused by a single nuclear  mutation. This novel mutation was designated <italic>mdm17.</italic> </p><p>To quantify the effect of <italic>mdm17</italic> on mitochondrial distribution and morphology, cells were stained with DASPMI  and examined by fluorescence microscopy. In wild-type  cells incubated at either 23&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C, mitochondria appeared as extended, tubular structures, distributed throughout the cytoplasm of both mother and bud portions of the  cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, A and B). Mitochondria in cells harboring the  <italic>mdm17</italic> mutation appeared very similar to wild-type at  23&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A) but displayed dramatic changes in mitochondrial distribution and morphology after incubation at  37&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). In particular, mitochondrial aggregation  and empty daughter buds were apparent in many cells.  These alterations in mitochondrial distribution and morphology were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence  microscopy (data not shown).</p><p>To examine the development of mutant phenotypes at  37&#x000b0;C, populations of mutant cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy at various times after shifting to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, A  and B). After 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, most cells (87%) contained aggregated mitochondria, and a significant fraction of cells  (18%) possessed buds devoid of mitochondria. Some of  the cells with empty buds still possessed mitochondria with  normal tubular morphology (data not shown). By 2 h, 90%  of cells displayed aggregated mitochondria and a majority  (56%) possessed empty buds. These results demonstrate  that the <italic>mdm17</italic> mutation rapidly causes defects in mitochondrial distribution and morphology after shifting cells  to the nonpermissive temperature. </p><p>The fraction of cells in the mutant population that  showed mitochondrial staining with the potential-dependent dye DASPMI decreased during incubation at the  nonpermissive temperature, suggesting that the cells were  becoming respiration deficient. To analyze this phenotype,  <italic>mdm17</italic> cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for various times,  plated on glucose (YPD) medium, and cultured at 23&#x000b0;C.  Colonies were tested for respiratory competence by replica plating onto glycerol (YPG) medium. At early times,  almost all cells were respiration competent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C). Significant numbers of respiration-deficient cells began appearing in the population only after 4 h at 37&#x000b0;C. After 24 h,  &#x0003e;95% of the cells were respiration deficient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C).  When cells from the 16-h time point were stained with the  DNA-binding dye 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole and examined by fluorescence microscopy, mitochondrial DNA  staining was no longer evident in a majority of cells (data  not shown), indicating that the respiration deficiency reflected a loss of mitochondrial DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>mdm17 Is Allelic to MGM1, a Gene Implicated in  Maintenance of the Mitochondrial Genome</title><p>To identify the molecular basis for the <italic>mdm17</italic> phenotypes, the wild-type <italic>MDM17</italic> gene was cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth defect of  <italic>mdm17</italic> mutant cells. From 10,000 transformants, four  strains harboring complementing plasmids were isolated.  Restriction mapping of the yeast genomic DNA inserts in  these plasmids indicated that all contained overlapping  clones. DNA sequence analysis and comparison with sequences in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database indicated that the genomic inserts in the plasmids corresponded to a region of chromosome XV. Deletion analysis  of the plasmids localized complementing activity to a single open reading frame corresponding to the previously  identified <italic>MGM1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Jones and Fangman, 1992</xref>). Transformation of <italic>mdm17</italic> cells with a centromere-based plasmid containing only a single copy of <italic>MGM1</italic> complemented all of the mutant phenotypes. Finally, the <italic>mdm17</italic>  mutation was localized to the <italic>MGM1</italic> locus by integrative  transformation and mapping (described in Materials and  Methods). These results demonstrate that <italic>mdm17</italic> is a mutant allele of <italic>MGM1.</italic></p><p>Previous studies reported that <italic>mgm1</italic> mutant cells  readily lost mitochondrial DNA and contained aggregated  mitochondria but showed normal mitochondrial distribution to buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Guan et al., 1993</xref>). This latter property differs  from the phenotype of the <italic>mdm17</italic> mutant, where a large  fraction of cells exhibited buds devoid of mitochondria.  Accordingly, the phenotype of a null mutant in <italic>mgm1</italic> generated in the same strain background as the <italic>mdm17</italic> mutant was examined. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed many <italic>mgm1</italic>-null cells with buds devoid of  mitochondria, even in cells cultured at 23&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As  previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Guan et al., 1993</xref>), mitochondria in  the <italic>mgm1</italic>-null strain were extensively aggregated. </p></sec><sec><title>Mgm1p Is Localized to the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane</title><p>Previously reported phenotypes of the <italic>mgm1</italic> mutant, together with the resemblance of the protein's predicted  NH<sub>2</sub> terminus to a mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggested that Mgm1p is a mitochondrial protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Guan et al.,  1993</xref>). However, direct evidence of the protein's subcellular location was lacking. To determine the functional location of Mgm1p, antibodies were generated that were specific for a peptide corresponding to the extreme COOH  terminus. These antibodies were used to detect the protein  in subcellular fractions. Immunoblotting of total cellular  extracts indicated that the affinity-purified antibodies recognized two polypeptides of &#x0223c;100 and 90 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A).  Neither of these species was apparent in <italic>mgm1</italic>-null cells  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A), indicating that both polypeptides are products  of the <italic>MGM1</italic> gene. Furthermore, both species displayed  substantially increased levels in cells harboring a multicopy (2 &#x003bc;) plasmid encoding <italic>MGM1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). These increased levels had no apparent effect on mitochondrial  distribution and morphology (data not shown). </p><p>The exact relationship between the two Mgm1p species  is unclear, but the 90-kD form appears to be derived from  the 100-kD form by proteolysis. The relative amounts of  the two species varied randomly in different experiments,  and pulse&#x02013;chase analysis in intact cells failed to reveal  a biosynthetic precursor-product relationship (data not  shown). However, prolonged incubation of subcellular  fractions in vitro (even at 0&#x000b0;C in the presence of a cocktail  of protease inhibitors) led to conversion of the larger species to the smaller form (data not shown). These results  suggest that the 90-kD form is a product of the partial proteolytic degradation of the 100-kD species.</p><p>Earlier characterization of <italic>MGM1</italic> failed to identify  which of five NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal methionine residues in the  predicted open reading frame actually constituted the  translational start of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Jones and Fangman,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Guan et al., 1993</xref>). To resolve this uncertainty, in  vitro mutagenesis was used to generate versions of <italic>mgm1</italic>  in which individual methionine codons were converted to  alanine codons. These mutant versions were tested for  their complementation of the phenotypes of <italic>mgm1</italic>-null  cells. No complementation was observed (and the protein  was not detected) when methionine-2 was changed to alanine (data not shown). Mutation of the remaining four methionines did not affect complementation of the mutant  defects, and both 100- and 90-kD forms of Mgm1p were  detected in cells harboring these genes. These results indicate that the authentic translational start residue is methionine-2 (referred to henceforth as residue 1 of the coding region).</p><p>The subcellular distribution of Mgm1p was characterized by immunoblotting of proteins extracted from subcellular fractions isolated from wild-type cells. Mgm1p was  localized predominantly to a subcellular fraction enriched  in mitochondrial proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). Analysis of purified  submitochondrial fractions revealed that Mgm1p was associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>  C). Furthermore, Mgm1p was susceptible to protease  treatment of intact mitochondria under conditions where  internal proteins, such as the matrix-localized Mas2p, were  protected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D).</p><p>To examine the nature of Mgm1p association with the  outer membrane, isolated mitochondria were extracted  with sodium chloride and with sodium carbonate. The latter treatment strips peripheral proteins but leaves integral  proteins embedded in the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Fujiki et al., 1982</xref>).  Mgm1p was resistant to extraction with 1 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>),  indicating that the protein was tightly associated with the  membrane. After carbonate treatment, the 90-kD form of  Mgm1p was recovered in the soluble fraction, while the  100-kD form remained associated with the membrane  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This result indicates that the full-length Mgm1p is  an integral membrane protein. The behavior of the 90-kD  fragment suggests that Mgm1p is embedded in the membrane via the putative membrane-spanning domain in the  NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, since both Mgm1p species are recognized  by the antibody specific for the extreme COOH terminus. </p><p>The state of Mgm1p in the mitochondrial outer membrane was further characterized by gel filtration analysis of  mitochondrial proteins solubilized in 1% Triton X-100.  About 60% of Mgm1p eluted in a peak corresponding to a  molecular mass of &#x0223c;400 kD, while the remainder of the  protein eluted in a peak appropriate to the monomeric  size (90&#x02013;100 kD) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The 90-kD (fragment) form of  the protein eluted in a distinct peak with an apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;120 kD (data not shown). The elution  behavior of Mgm1p was distinct from that of two other  integral proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane,  Tom70p and OM45 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results suggest that  Mgm1p is part of a high molecular mass complex either in  a homo-oligomeric state or complexed with other proteins  on the mitochondrial surface. </p></sec><sec><title>Mgm1p Function Depends on the Conserved GTP-binding Domain</title><p>To explore further the function of Mgm1p, the identity of  the <italic>mdm17</italic> mutation was determined. The mutant gene  contained a single change: a transition of G to A at nucleotide 880, resulting in a change of Glu<sup>294</sup> to Lys. This lesion mapped near the conserved, tripartite GTP-binding  motif, suggesting a role for this site in Mgm1p function. To  test the importance of the GTP-binding site, a mutant  form of <italic>MGM1</italic> incorporating a change in a conserved residue, S224N, was created (the numbering of this residue is  based on the designation of the second methionine in  <italic>MGM1</italic> as the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal residue as described above).  The equivalent mutation in the H-ras-GTPase (S17N)  eliminates the protein's binding of GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Feig and Cooper, 1988</xref>), and a corresponding mutation in rat dynamin  (S45N) blocks the protein's function in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Herskovits et al., 1993</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of cellular extracts detected Mgm1p in <italic>mgm1</italic>-null cells harboring the  mutant gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). However, the <italic>mgm1</italic>-S224N gene  failed to complement any of the mutant phenotypes of a  cell containing an <italic>mgm1</italic>-null lesion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B and data not  shown). In addition, the <italic>mgm1</italic>-S224N gene did not complement the growth or mitochondrial distribution and  morphology defects of the <italic>mdm17</italic> mutant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> C).  These results indicate that an intact GTP-binding domain  is essential for Mgm1p function. </p><p>Overexpression of dynamin family members mutated in  critical residues of the GTP-binding site was previously  found to cause dominant-negative effects in wild-type cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Warnock and Schmid, 1996</xref>). To test whether this is also  true for <italic>MGM1</italic>, high-copy plasmids encoding either wild-type <italic>MGM1</italic> or <italic>mgm1</italic>-S224N were transformed into wild-type cells. Only a small number of transformants harboring  the mutant gene was recovered, and Western blot analysis  indicated that the mutant protein was not overexpressed  in these cells (perhaps reflecting a regulatory or suppression phenomenon). However, both wild-type and mutant  proteins were overexpressed in <italic>mgm1</italic>-null cells harboring  the respective plasmids (data not shown). These transformed cells were mated to wild-type cells, and the effect  of overexpression in the resulting zygotes was analyzed by  fluorescence microscopy. High levels of wild-type <italic>MGM1</italic>  had no apparent effect on mitochondrial distribution or  morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A), but zygotes with elevated levels of  the mutant protein displayed defects very similar to those  caused by the original <italic>mdm17</italic> mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A). In particular, 90% of the latter zygotes displayed aggregated mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B), and 52% of the buds produced by  these zygotes contained no mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B). These  results demonstrate that the <italic>mgm1</italic>-S224N mutant gene  product confers dominant-negative effects on mitochondrial distribution and morphology. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified a role for Mgm1p in mitochondrial inheritance through the analysis of cells harboring <italic>mdm17</italic>, a  mutation causing temperature-sensitive growth and alterations in mitochondrial distribution and morphology. Genetic analysis revealed that <italic>mdm17</italic> is a mutant allele of  <italic>MGM1</italic>, a nuclear gene originally identified by its role in  maintenance of the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Jones and  Fangman, 1992</xref>). Two key observations indicate that the  primary functions of Mgm1p are to facilitate the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and to mediate mitochondrial inheritance and that mitochondrial genome  maintenance is a secondary role of the protein. First, analysis of <italic>mdm17</italic> cells revealed that alterations in mitochondrial morphology and distribution appeared very quickly  after a shift to elevated temperature, whereas loss of respiratory competence and the mitochondrial genome occurred only much later. Second, the location of Mgm1p on  the mitochondrial surface is consistent with a primary function of the protein in morphology and distribution, but not  with a direct role in maintenance of the matrix-localized  mitochondrial DNA. In addition, several other mutations  that cause aberrant mitochondrial morphology also cause  increased loss of mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Sogo and Yaffe, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berger et al., 1997</xref>). This loss appears  to be a secondary effect of the morphological changes.</p><p>Mgm1p is one of a small group of outer membrane proteins that have been shown to be required for mitochondrial inheritance. Mdm10p, Mdm12p, and Mmm1p are  also integral proteins of the outer membrane whose loss  leads to dramatic alterations in mitochondrial morphology  and defects in transmission of mitochondria into developing daughter buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Burgess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Sogo and Yaffe,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berger et al., 1997</xref>). Although the specific molecular  activities of these other components are unknown, their  location in the mitochondrial outer membrane and their  exposed cytoplasmic domains suggest two potential models of function. One possibility is that these proteins serve  as binding sites or anchor points for interaction with cytoskeletal structures or molecular motors. Such interactions might pull mitochondria into tubular structures and  mediate mitochondrial movement into buds. A second  possibility is that the outer membrane components regulate structural properties of the outer membrane, such as  membrane fluidity, which are themselves essential for normal mitochondrial morphology and inheritance. Additionally, mitochondrial inheritance may depend on a tubular  morphology that is maintained by these outer membrane  proteins. Mgm1p may function in concert with the other  outer membrane proteins, or it may fulfill a unique role.  This latter possibility is suggested by the observation that  phenotypes caused by <italic>mdm10</italic>, <italic>mdm12</italic>, and <italic>mmm1</italic> are  suppressed by the <italic>SOT1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Berger et al., 1997</xref>) but  defects caused by mutations in <italic>mgm1</italic> are not (data not  shown).</p><p>Mgm1p is a member of the dynamin family of large  GTP-binding proteins. The best characterized member of  this family is dynamin itself, which plays an essential role  in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Herskovits et al., 1993</xref>; van der Bleik et al., 1993). Although <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does not have a true dynamin orthologue, this yeast  possesses two other dynamin-like proteins, Vps1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Vater  et al., 1992</xref>) and Dnm1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gammie et al., 1995</xref>). Vps1p is  localized to the Golgi apparatus and participates in the vesicular transport of proteins to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Vater et al.,  1992</xref>). Dnm1p may function in the endosomal pathway  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Gammie et al., 1995</xref>), but was recently found to play an  important role in mitochondrial distribution and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Otsuga et al., 1998</xref>). In particular, cells deleted for  Dnm1p displayed mitochondrial tubules collapsed along  one side of the cell and extending from the mother portion  of the cell into the daughter bud. A related phenotype, the  collapse of mitochondrial tubules into perinuclear aggregates, was observed in an independent study in which a  mutant form of the human dynamin-like protein, Drp1,  was expressed in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Smirnova et al.,  1998</xref>). These observations suggest that Dnm1p and its  mammalian homologue Drp1 may mediate the lateral distribution or branching of mitochondrial tubules.</p><p>Many molecular details of dynamin's function in endocytosis remain to be clarified, but key features of the  protein's activity include GTP hydrolysis and assembly of  dynamin into oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Herskovits et al.,  1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hinshaw and Schmid, 1995</xref>). Dynamin has been proposed to act as a mechanical constrictor for the neck of an  invaginating coated pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Warnock and Schmid, 1996</xref>), or as  a regulator or recruiter of the constriction machinery  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Roos and Kelly, 1997</xref>). Although it is not apparent that a  constricting activity is necessary for the maintenance of  mitochondrial morphology and distribution, our results  suggest that Mgm1p shares two key functional features  with dynamin. First, mutational analysis revealed that the  GTP-binding site is essential for Mgm1p function, suggesting the importance of GTP hydrolysis. Second, the dominant-negative effect of the S224N mutation and the wild-type protein's gel filtration profile suggest that Mgm1p  functions as part of an oligomeric complex. Mgm1p might  play a structural role in locally influencing the properties  of the outer membrane. For example, Mgm1p could assemble into a structure that promotes a tubular mitochondrial morphology. Alternatively, Mgm1p might fulfill a  regulatory function in controlling the activity of other  membrane components. More details of the protein's  function should emerge from identification of interacting  proteins.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><table-wrap position="float" id="TI"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Yeast Strains </p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Strain</th><th/><th>Genotype</th><th/><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">MYY290</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, <italic>his3, leu2, ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Smith and Yaffe, 1991</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY291</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>his3, leu2, ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Smith and Yaffe, 1991</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY298</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>/&#x003b1;, <italic>his3/his3, leu2/leu2, &#x02003;ura3/ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Smith and Yaffe, 1991</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY900</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>mdm13, his3, leu2, ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY971</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>mdm17, his3, leu2, ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY972</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, <italic>mdm17, his3, leu2, ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY973</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>/&#x003b1;, <italic>mgm1&#x00394;::LEU2/MGM1, &#x02003;his3/his3, leu2/leu2, ura3/ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY974</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold>, <italic>mgm1&#x00394;::LEU2, his3, leu2, &#x02003;ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left">MYY975</td><td align="left"/><td align="left"><italic>MAT</italic>&#x003b1;, <italic>mgm1&#x00394;::LEU2, his3, leu2, &#x02003;ura3</italic></td><td align="left"/><td align="left">This study</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>mdm17</italic> cells are conditionally defective for mitochondrial inheritance and mitochondrial morphology.
