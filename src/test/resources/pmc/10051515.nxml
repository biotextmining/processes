Release  the membrane potential that normally holds it closed,  and massive stored molecular energies snap it rapidly  and inexorably into its open configuration. Unlocking  the inner secrets of this voltage-dependent channel's  gating mechanism has proven to be much more difficult. An article by Ledwell and Aldrich in this issue has  opened that door significantly.</p><p>An impressive array of experimental techniques and  intellectual powers have been used to attack this problem over the past half century. Techniques such as the  voltage clamp for measuring macroscopic and gating  currents, and the patch clamp for small cells and single  channels were developed to study voltage-dependent  channels. Molecular cloning and mutagenesis, cysteine-site availability, limiting slope measurements, fluorescence labeling, rescue mutations, as well as temperature, pressure, water, and ionic alterations have all  been brought to bear on the problem. An acceleration  of progress is apparent through the concerted efforts  of many groups.</p><p>Over the past year, <italic>The Journal of General Physiology</italic> has  hosted the latest round of discussion concerning the  activation mechanism of voltage-dependent K channels  (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cha and Bezanilla, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Loots and Isacoff, 1998</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Rodr&#x000ed;guez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Roux et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Schoppa  and&#x02002;Sigworth, 1998a</xref>&#x02013;c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>,b;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Zheng and Sigworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bao et al., 1999</xref>). A fascinating picture is emerging. Building on extensive previous  work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bezanilla et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Hoshi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Zagotta  et al., 1994</xref>), Schoppa and Sigworth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1998a</xref>&#x02013;c) started  off with a detailed analysis of macroscopic, gating, and  single channel currents in two forms of the channel.  The &#x0201c;wild-type&#x0201d; channel, modified to remove fast inactivation, is the basic starting type for all the studies presented here. In addition, they examined the V2 mutant, which slows activation. Their concluding model,  though differing in detail from the models of others,  presents what has become a consensus view.</p><p>When closed, the channel's positively charged S4 segments (one in each of the channel's four subunits) are  cocked toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.  Upon depolarization, these S4 charges are pulled  through the membrane's electric field in a series of  steps that proceed essentially independently in each  subunit. After this unlatching, it appears that the  subunits act cooperatively to produce the final steps  of&#x02002;opening a central conductive pore. Schoppa and  Sigworth's (1998c) 3&#x0002b;2 model quantitatively describes  these steps, as shown here in Scheme I. </p><p>Three independent steps are shown for each of the  four subunits, followed by two cooperative steps. At 0  mV, each reaction is fast in the forward direction, and  slow to reverse (the rate per second at 0 mV is shown  with each step above). Note, however, that most of  the&#x02002;&#x02009;voltage dependence (i.e., the effective charge, Q,  that determines how the unidirectional reaction rates  change with voltage) is in the reverse reactions. At the  resting potential, the reverse reaction rates will be  greatly increased, strongly enhancing the probability  that the channel is in one of its closed states.</p><p>When looking at these types of kinetics, we've grown  used to thinking in terms of rates, charges, and the reactions necessary to open a voltage-dependent channel.  What has been emphasized less, even if known by all, is  that channels desperately want to be open. When no  membrane field is applied (e.g., at 0 mV), they essentially &#x0201c;fall&#x0201d; into the open state, and barring inactivation  or other flickers, would stay there. Seen from this perspective, the challenge is to keep the channel closed reliably! </p><p>Recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bao et al. (1999)</xref> highlights this  point. When most of the charge is mutated out of the  <italic>Shaker</italic> S4 (specifically charges in the 1, 2, 4, and 7 positions), the primary functional deficit is the ability of  voltage to close the channel. The pore conducts normally, and appears to retain vestiges of C-type inactivation, pore gating, etc., but this activity is now uncoupled from voltage.</p><p>Consider the forces that are applied in dragging the  channel back from its open state. The average force on  a single charge in a voltage gradient, like that inside a  membrane, is easily calculated by <italic>F</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>q d</italic>&#x02009;V/<italic>dx</italic>, where  volts, V, are defined as J/C, a single charge <italic>q</italic> is 1.6 &#x000d7;  10<sup>&#x02212;19</sup> C, and <italic>dx</italic> is (at greatest) the width in meters of  the hydrophobic portion of bilayer or protein. A reasonable minimum estimate of <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;V/<italic>dx</italic> at &#x02212;100 mV potential is 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> V/meter, which will give a force per  charge of at least 4 pN. This seems a trivial force until one  compares it to the nearly identical range of forces generated by each myosin molecule in a muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Huxley and  Tideswell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Guilford et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, the work  done in moving the channel's 12&#x02013;14 effective charges  through the membrane field during gating is equivalent to the energy derived from splitting four ATP molecules. As the channel closes during hyperpolarization,  all this force is brought to bear on the molecular machinery. Work is done pulling back on internal springs,  &#x0201c;cocking&#x0201d; the channel for the next quick release.</p><p>These concepts, though general, serve to focus further questions for understanding channel function.  How do the forces that result from hyperpolarization  cause the disassembly of the open state? Do all charges  participate equally in delivering these forces, or are the  steps truly sequential, with only a few charges exerting  force during any one step? Is there a subset of the  charges in the S4 that also drives the final, channel-wide rearrangements surrounding the pore opening?  Are the reaction steps that close the channel simply the  reverse of the channel's opening steps?</p><p>Unfortunately, the wild-type channel is not always  conducive to the study of such detailed mechanistic  questions. The rates and voltage dependencies of its  various reactions are closely tuned and often quite fast.  Even by studying its kinetics under conditions (e.g., at  extremes of voltage) that bias measured rates toward  single reaction steps, as Schoppa and Sigworth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1998a</xref>&#x02013;c)  have done, the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel but grudgingly unlocks  its secrets.</p><p>A series of studies by Smith-Maxwell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1998a</xref>,b)  and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Ledwell and Aldrich (1999)</xref> have helped to bypass this problems and answer some of the questions.  They noted in a pair of articles published here last  year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998a</xref>,b) that several relatives of the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel have distinctly different patterns of gating. In particular, the Shaw form of the  channel has less voltage dependence to its gating, requires much more positive potentials to open, and has  slower, monoexponential, kinetics. To determine if  these properties were linked to alterations in the S4  structure, they swapped the whole Shaw S4 sequence  into a <italic>Shaker</italic> channel. In the first article, they showed  that this swap confers a number of Shaw-like properties  into <italic>Shaker</italic>. The <italic>Shaker</italic>-Shaw-S4 chimera channel activates slowly with monoexponential kinetics, and requires positive potentials to open significantly. Using  kinetic analysis and tandem dimer expression, they  concluded that the primary alteration was in the step  closest to opening, where subunits have their primary  cooperativity.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Smith-Maxwell et al. (1998b)</xref> showed that, of the 11  different amino acids in the Shaw S4 (including neutralization or reversal of the first, second, and seventh  charges), mutating just three noncharged residues  (V369I, I372L, and S376T, called &#x0201c;ILT&#x0201d;) of the wild-type <italic>Shaker</italic> channel into the Shaw equivalents made a  critical difference. This ILT mutation gave the wild-type channel properties that were virtually identical to  the Shaw-S4 chimera. They further demonstrated with  quantitative modeling that virtually all of their results  could be explained by raising the barrier height, slowing the final cooperative opening transition, and by increasing the charge that powers this reaction step.  These results, along with those of Schoppa and Sigworth's V2 mutation, provide evidence for a functional  distinction between early independent gating transitions and late cooperative ones.</p><p>But, if the ILT charge-neutral mutation gave rise to  behavior virtually identical to the Shaw-S4 chimera,  what is the role of the altered charge in Shaw? Do these  charges, which have been implicated in other studies  (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bao et al., 1999</xref>) as being important in determining the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel's voltage dependence, become  irrelevant in Shaw?</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Ledwell and Aldrich (1999)</xref>, published in this volume, answers these questions. The work compares the  gating properties of the ILT and Shaw-S4 mutant channels, with particular emphasis on establishing the properties of the now separable early and late transitions.</p><p>The ILT channel was quantified and modeled in  terms of its macroscopic currents, its gating currents,  and its activation delays (i.e., sigmoidicity or Cole-Moore shift). Most of the gating charge moves quickly  and at negative voltages. There is also now a clearly distinguishable fraction of gating charge (&#x0223c;13%) that is  associated with the slowed opening steps at positive potentials. The ILT channel also shows the familiar activation delays that seem to be the hallmark of channels  with extensive S4 movement.</p><p>Interestingly, the Shaw-S4 mutant was found to lack  these early voltage-dependent transitions almost completely. Despite extensive efforts, no pulse protocol or  voltage range could be found that caused either activation delays or fast charge movement in the Shaw-S4 mutant channel. Instead, its gating charge was slow and  flowed at more positive potentials, like the 13% subset  in the ILT channel. Returning three charges (located  where the first, second, and seventh charges of Shaker  are found in the wild-type S4 region) to the Shaw-S4 rescued the early charge-moving steps in the mutant channel. The Shaw-S4 channel demonstrates, in effect, the  completely separate nature of the late transition, which  can be seen to function in isolation in this channel.</p><p>As these results unfold, so too does a more complete  picture of <italic>Shaker</italic> channel gating function. Only a subset  of the gating charge (&#x0223c;1.8 <italic>e</italic><sub>o</sub> for the whole channel)  appears to be involved directly with creating or destroying the channel's conductive state (i.e., the final transition between closed and open). Whereas in the wild-type channel this transition is fast and easy, it requires  extra energy in both ILT and Shaw due to changes in  S4's hydrophobic residues. Like a door that is misaligned and hangs on stiff hinges, the ILT and Shaw  channel's opening and closing steps require extra  force. The 1.8 effective charges, therefore, can be observed providing that force in both the forward and  backward direction.</p><p>These late reactions are concerted or cooperative  steps; i.e., the configuration of each subunit influences  its neighbors. Intermediate states are unstable and the  subunits tend to stay in precise lock-step with one another. Thus, the gating charge for this reaction step is  likely to be distributed between the subunits. The location of this charge is still unknown, although the recent  results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bao et al. (1999)</xref> might cast eyes upon the  fourth S4 charge.</p><p>And what of the remaining charges? It is now clear  that the independent S4 movements don't contribute  directly to the forces necessary to close the conducting  pore. The massive energies dedicated here appear to  be involved, rather, in bolting the door once closed,  much like a series of dead bolts on an urban apartment  entry. Opening the <italic>Shaker</italic> channel is easy&#x02014;too easy.  Our new perspective on gating function implies that  keeping it shut reliably is the challenge for which much  of S4's charges are adapted.</p><p>As the puzzle pieces (many of them published here  in the past year) fall into place, a clearer picture of voltage-dependent channel gating is taking shape. The picture, in turn, may help to place further pieces. This cooperative interaction of many excellent laboratories  may thus serve to unlock rapidly the secrets of this important gating function.</p></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="FSI"><label>Scheme I</label><graphic xlink:href="JGP7926.s1"/></fig></sec><ref-list><title>references</title><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Hakeem</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henteleff</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Starkus</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Rayner</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Voltage-insensitive gating after charge-neutralizing mutations in the S4 segment of <italic>Shaker</italic>channels</article-title><source>J Gen Physiol</source><year>1999</year><volume>113</volume><fpage>139</fpage><lpage>151</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9874694</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bezanilla</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Perozo</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Stefani</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Gating of <italic>Shaker</italic>K channels: II.
