As for the case of ClC-0, the probabilities and dwell times of the closed and conducting states are consistent with the presence of two independently gated pathways with &#x02248; 1.2 pS conductance  enabled in parallel via a common gate. However, the voltage dependence of the common gate is different and the  kinetics are much faster than for ClC-0. Estimates of single-channel parameters from the analysis of macroscopic  current fluctuations agree with those from single-channel recordings. Fluctuation analysis was used to characterize changes in the apparent double-gate behavior of the ClC-1 mutations I290M and I556N causing, respectively, a  dominant and a recessive form of myotonia. We find that both mutations reduce about equally the open probability of single protopores and that mutation I290M yields a stronger reduction of the common gate open probability  than mutation I556N. Our results suggest that the mammalian ClC-homologues have the same structure and  mechanism proposed for the <italic>Torpedo</italic> channel ClC-0. Differential effects on the two gates that appear to modulate  the activation of ClC-1 channels may be important determinants for the different patterns of inheritance of dominant and recessive ClC-1 mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ClC-0</kwd><kwd>fast gate</kwd><kwd>slow gate</kwd><kwd>subconductance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Introduction"><title>introduction</title><p>ClC proteins represent a class of voltage-dependent Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>  channels with several members involved in hereditary  human diseases. The Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel prototype ClC-0 from  <italic>Torpedo</italic> is a dimeric protein behaving as if comprising  two protopores that can gate independently from each  other and a common gate that acts on both protopores  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Miller, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Middleton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ludewig et al.,  1996</xref>). Such behavior, suggestive of a &#x0201c;double-barreled&#x0201d;  structure, has not been demonstrated for other ClC  proteins at the single channel level. Indeed, a double-barreled structure of ClC-1 has recently been challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Using single channel recording, we show that also  the muscle Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel, ClC-1, has two equidistant  open conductance levels of &#x02248; 1.2 and 2.4 pS whose  open probability and kinetics are consistent with the  presence of two independently gated conductance  states modulated in parallel by a common gate, although the relatively fast kinetics of the common gate  render their separation less obvious than for ClC-0. We  verified that the most simple scheme implementing a  double-gate two-protopores model fits well the single-channel data and predicts, for the same single-channel  parameters, current fluctuations consistent with macroscopic measurements. Several mutations of ClC-1 causing dominant myotonia lead to a positive shift of the  voltage dependence of the conductance that is only  partially reversed in mutant/wild-type (WT)<sup>1</sup> heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Pusch et al., 1995b</xref>). We have used macroscopic fluctuation analysis to characterize changes in  the double-gate behavior of two mutations of ClC-1  causing dominant or recessive myotonia. Mutation  I290M, causing a positive shift of the voltage dependence of the conductance that is only partially reversed  in mutant/WT heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Pusch et al., 1995b</xref>),  shows a strong reduction of the open probability of the  common gate. In contrast, we found that for mutation  I556N, which causes a recessive or benign form of dominant myotonia and does not impose its &#x0201c;shift&#x0201d; on WT/ mutant heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kubisch et al., 1998</xref>), the open  probability of the common gate is reduced less dramatically.</p><p>Our results suggest that the mammalian ClC homologues have the same double-barreled structure as the  <italic>Torpedo</italic> channel ClC-0. In addition, our findings for recessive and dominant mutations raise the possibility  that, for other mutations also, the pattern of inheritance may derive from differential effects on the double-gate mechanism of ClC-1 activation.</p></sec><sec id="Methods" sec-type="methods"><title>methods</title><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Channels were expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and currents were  measured at 18&#x000b0;C 2&#x02013;5 d after injection using the inside-out  configuration of the patch clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Hamill et al.,  1981</xref>).

Single-channel  studies of ClC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Steinmeyer et al., 1991b</xref>) are more difficult due to ClC-1's low conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Pusch et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Wollnik et al., 1997</xref>) and fast gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Pusch et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Fahlke et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1998</xref>).  Low intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) leads to a slowing of gating  kinetics and to an increase of the residual open probability at negative voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>). This  effect of intracellular pH is illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. We  have exploited both effects to resolve single channel  events of ClC-1 at low pH<sub>i</sub>.  </p><p>To this end, ClC-1 was expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes  and we recorded currents from membrane micropatches using the inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Hamill et al., 1981</xref>) and pH 6.5 in  the bath (internal) solution. To search for single-channel events, we first used relatively large-tipped patch- pipettes (resistance of 1&#x02013;3 M&#x003a9;) to identify a region of  the oocyte with significant but not too high expression.  We then patched the same region of the oocyte membrane using pipettes with smaller tip openings (resistance of 4&#x02013;8 M&#x003a9;). In a few patches (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 9), we succeeded in obtaining recording conditions (high seal resistance, low background noise, and relatively long  stability) allowing fairly clear resolution of single-channel events (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). These records showed invariably  two approximately equidistant open conductance levels  easily distinguishable above the background noise at  voltages between &#x02212;100 and &#x02212;140 mV. From Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A,  another important qualitative feature can be observed;  i.e., fairly common closing periods separate bursts of  openings that almost invariably contain both conductance levels. This behavior is similar to that of ClC-0  channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Miller, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Miller and Richard, 1990</xref>) and  has been modeled as arising from the gating transitions  of a double-pore channel with an independent parallel  modulation by a common gate. </p><p>Amplitude histograms of long recordings confirm these  qualitative observations. The histograms are very well  fitted by the sum of three gaussian distributions with  equidistant peaks (<italic>i</italic><sub>0 </sub>&#x02261;  0, <italic>i</italic><sub>1</sub>, 2<italic>i</italic><sub>1</sub>) and additive variances  (&#x003c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>, &#x003c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> &#x0002b; &#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>, &#x003c3;<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> &#x0002b; 2&#x003c3;<sup>2</sup>) as explained in <sc>methods</sc> (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). Accordingly, the relative areas covered by the  three gaussian components yield the probabilities <italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>,  <italic>P</italic><sub>1</sub>, and <italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> of the closed and of the two open levels, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C). A simple analysis shows that the  values of the probabilities are grossly departing from  the expectations from a simple binomial superposition  of two independently gating channels each with open  probability <italic>P</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C, circles). Therefore, it can be excluded that the two open conductance levels are due to  the presence of two identical and independent channels, and the invariable presence of both levels in all  patches forces the conclusion that our recordings of  the type shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A represent a single channel  that has two open states, one with twice the conductance of the other. Based on the stationary probabilities  obtained from the amplitude histograms, a model with  two independently gated and equally sized conductances with possibly different open probabilities <italic>P</italic><sub>A</sub> and  <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A), can be excluded. Best fits of  such a model to experimental amplitude histograms invariably yielded <italic>P</italic><sub>A</sub> &#x0003d; <italic>P</italic><sub>B</sub>, and thus the same bad prediction as the binomial superposition of two identical  channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C, circles). </p><p>One long registration at &#x02212;140 mV from a patch containing a single channel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A) allowed us to perform  a fair statistical analysis of dwell times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). This  showed that histograms of single- and double-opening  times were well fitted by single exponential distributions,  whereas a single exponential was inadequate to fit the  closed time histogram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, top, dashed line). </p><p>A model that can account for our observations must  include a common gate that modulates the access to a  conduction pathway that can have three different conductances (0, &#x003b3;, 2&#x003b3;). The simplest kinetic scheme (with  the smallest number of parameters) is shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B. The three conductance levels of the &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; common gate are modeled by a binomial superposition of  two equal and independent processes. The kinetic  scheme can be mechanistically interpreted according  to either one of the models shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> (C or D).  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C assumes the classical double-barreled structure where Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> has equal access to two parallel, equal  and, independent two-state protopores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Miller, 1982</xref>).  In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> is allowed by the common gate to enter a single permeation pathway that, however, can assume three different conformations. As discussed later,  there are several arguments in favor of either interpretation, but it is important to stress that both lead to  the very same kinetic scheme. For analogy with ClC-0,  we adopt in the following the interpretation and terminology of the double-pore model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C) for describing the data in terms of the kinetic scheme of  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B.</p><p>The simple double-barreled model is characterized  by the single-protopore open probability <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>, a probability <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> for the opening of the common slow gate, and the  independence of the two gating processes. It can reproduce exactly the stationary probabilities of the three  conductance levels obtained from the amplitude histograms using the relationships:  <disp-formula><tex-math id="M8">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

The exact fit of the data does not  demonstrate the model because we have two parameters and two independent data points. However, the  consistency of the values of <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub>, and &#x003b3; with other measurements can be used as a more stringent test of its validity. Firstly, the single channel currents give a conductance &#x003b3; of 1.2&#x02013;1.3 pS for each protopore (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C, left,  &#x02022;), which is in good agreement with previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Pusch  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Wollnik et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Rychkov et al., 1998</xref>)  and present noise analysis (see below) of macroscopic  currents clearly attributable to ClC-1 channels. This  also supports the assumption that the events indeed  represent openings of ClC-1 and not endogenous channels. Furthermore, both <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C, &#x02022;) are only  a little voltage dependent in the small voltage range investigated and have values well above 0.5, that are consistent with the macroscopic activation curve of ClC-1 at  pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The double-barreled model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is also consistent  with our measurements of dwell-time distributions,  since it predicts in particular single exponential dwell-time distributions for both open levels and a multiexponential distribution for the closed times (the theory  predicts four exponentials, but major contributions are  only from two components). To obtain best estimates  for the four rate constants in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B, the dwell-time  histograms were fitted simultaneously according to  the double-barreled model using maximum likelihood  techniques (see <sc>methods</sc>). The histograms are well fitted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, solid lines) with the rate constants given  in the legend to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. From the rate constants, the stationary probabilities can be calculated as <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> &#x0003d; &#x003b1;/(&#x003b1; &#x0002b;  &#x003b2;) &#x0003d; 0.59 and <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> &#x0003d; &#x003bb;/(&#x003bb; &#x0002b; &#x003bc;) &#x0003d; 0.68. These values are  close to those obtained independently from the amplitude histogram of the same patch (<italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> &#x0003d; 0.48, <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> &#x0003d;  0.74), supporting further the validity of the double-barreled model. We notice that, while the relaxation time  constant of the fast gate, &#x003c4;<sub>f</sub> [defined as 1/(&#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2;)], is  similar to that of ClC-0 at &#x02212;100 mV, that of the slow  gate, &#x003c4;<sub>s</sub> [defined as 1/(&#x003bb; &#x0002b; &#x003bc;)], is less than three times  larger and more than two orders of magnitude smaller  than for ClC-0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Pusch et al., 1997</xref>; our unpublished results) making the dissection of the two gating processes  much more difficult. These two time constants of gating probably correspond to the two macroscopic time  constants of current deactivation described by Fahlke  et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al. (1996)</xref> that also  differ by a factor of 3&#x02013;5.</p><p>In contrast to their qualitative similarities in showing  two equally spaced conductance levels, a major difference in the gating properties of ClC-1 and ClC-0 is the  different voltage dependence of the slow gating mechanism. In ClC-0, the slow gate closes at positive voltages  leading to a small steady state macroscopic conductance in the positive voltage range. In contrast, in ClC-1,  the overall steady state conductance increases monotonically with increasing voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Pusch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), implying that the slow gate  remains open at positive voltages. From the noise analysis described below, it appears that the open probability  of the slow gate approaches a value of 1 at positive voltages, indicating that the slow gate has a reversed voltage dependence in ClC-1 compared with ClC-0. However, several point mutations of ClC-0 also lead to a loss  of voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ludewig et al., 1996</xref>) or even a reversed voltage dependence of the slow gate (our unpublished results).</p></sec><sec><title>Macroscopic Current Fluctuations</title><p>To extend our studies to physiological pH conditions  in which the faster kinetics prevent the recordings of  single channel events, we developed a method to estimate <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> from macroscopic current fluctuations.  The method is illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> for measurements at  pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5, and the analysis procedure is described in detail in the <sc>methods</sc>. From repeated stimulations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  A), the time course of the mean current and of its variance were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Pusch et al., 1994</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B) and  fitted with Eqs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E3">3</xref>. The best fitting values of <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>, <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub>,  and <italic>i</italic> thus obtained were consistent with those measured from the single-channel amplitude histograms  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C; compare &#x02022; and &#x025b5;). As already mentioned,  this good accordance of the single channel analysis and  the fluctuation analysis supports the assumption that  the single-channel events described above are indeed  due to ClC-1 channels and not to endogenous oocyte  channels. Vice versa, it justifies the use of macroscopic  fluctuation analysis for estimating the single channel  parameters of our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Myotonic Mutations</title><p>Mutations of ClC-1 can cause either dominant or recessive myotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Steinmeyer et al., 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Koch et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">George et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Pusch et al., 1995b</xref>). Recessive myotonia is frequently associated with mutations  leading to a partial or total loss of function (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Jentsch  and G&#x000fc;nther, 1997</xref>). This is consistent with the in vitro  result that a reduction of the macroscopic muscle Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>  conductance by 50% is not sufficient to cause myotonia  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Kwiecinski et al., 1988</xref>). Several dominant mutations  (as for example mutation I290M) lead to a large shift of  the conductance&#x02013;voltage curve to positive voltages of  homomeric channels that is only partially reduced in  wild-type (WT)/mutant heteromers, leaving a strong  reduction of the chloride conductance at the relevant  physiological voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Pusch et al., 1995b</xref>).</p><p>Recently, mutations that cause either recessive myotonia or a benign form of dominant myotonia with incomplete penetrance have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Plassart-Schiess et al., 1998</xref>) that show a positive shift of the  macroscopic conductance&#x02013;voltage relationship in homodimeric mutant channels, but form mutant/WT  heterodimers that behave almost like homomeric WT  channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kubisch et al., 1998</xref>). An example of these  mutations that do not impose the shift on WT/mutant  heteromers is the mutation I556N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kubisch et al.,  1998</xref>). The different behavior of mutant/WT heteromeric channels indicates that the mechanism underlying the shift of the conductance&#x02013;voltage curve of mutants I290M and I556N is different.</p><p>To investigate whether these two mutations produce  different effects on the two gates postulated by Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B,  we used macroscopic fluctuation analysis at the physiological pH<sub>i</sub> 7.3 to estimate and compare the values of &#x003b3;  and of the stationary probabilities for WT and mutants  I290M and I556N (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The WT value of &#x003b3; at pH<sub>i</sub> 7.3  was not significantly different from that at pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5, and  &#x003b3; was also not significantly affected by the mutations.  The WT estimates of <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> and <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> at &#x02212;100 mV were smaller  at pH<sub>i</sub> 7.3 than at pH<sub>i</sub> 6.5, consistent with the effect of  pH<sub>i</sub> on the macroscopic conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al.,  1996</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The relative macroscopic open probability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) compares well with the calculated product  <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>*<italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> from the noise analysis at both pH<sub>i</sub> values (not  shown), indicating that <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub> as well as <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> approach 1 at  large positive voltages. Also, the initial values [<italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>(0),  <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub>(0)] obtained from the noise analysis were close to 1  in most cases (see <sc>methods</sc>). For the same pH<sub>i</sub> 7.3 conditions, the estimated stationary open probabilities  were both significantly reduced by the mutations (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). In particular, mutant I290M shows a significantly  larger reduction of <italic>P</italic><sub>s </sub>than mutant I556N, whereas both  mutations cause a similar reduction of <italic>P</italic><sub>f</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>discussion</title><p>We presented in this work some new information that  is relevant for the modeling of the gating mechanism  of the muscle Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel ClC-1. Our single-channel  recordings show that the gating of this channel has  strong similarities with that of the &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; ClC prototype ClC-0, although the slow common gate of ClC-1  has faster kinetics and a different voltage dependence.  Therefore, we have assumed that many of the arguments suggesting that ClC-0 channels have a double-barreled structure apply also to ClC-1, and we have  used a simple kinetic scheme involving a common gate  on top of two parallel and independently gated pores  to fit our single-channel data. We have also shown that  the analysis of macroscopic current fluctuations on the  basis of that scheme gives consistent estimates of the  single-channel parameters. Macroscopic fluctuation measurements were then used to characterize two ClC-1 mutants linked to hereditary myotonias. Such analysis supports the simple mechanistic hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kubisch et  al. (1998)</xref> for the different inheritance pattern of the  two mutations in terms of the two-gate double-barreled  model: monomers of the recessive mutant I556N may  associate with WT subunits to form fairly functional  dimers because only the protopore provided by the mutant subunit has strongly modified properties, whereas  monomers of the dominant mutant I290M modify both  homodimers and mutant/WT heterodimers because they  affect the common gate.</p><p>To what extent do our results support the hypothesis  of a double-barreled structure of ClC-1? The fact that  our single-channel recordings are consistent with the  simple kinetic scheme of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B does not exclude the  possibility that more complicated gating schemes are  needed for a quantitative description of ClC-1 gating in  a wider range of voltage, in different ionic conditions,  and at a higher time resolution. Due to their small conductance and relatively fast kinetics, single ClC-1 channels can be observed with much less resolution than  ClC-0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ludewig et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Chen and Miller,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Middleton et al., 1996</xref>), and the argument in favor of an apparent double-barreled structure is correspondingly weaker. In particular, the relative kinetic  overlap of the fast and slow gates makes their distinction more difficult. Since ClC-0 and ClC-1 are structurally very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Jentsch et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Steinmeyer et al.,  1991b</xref>) and have several common permeation and gating properties (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Miller and Richard, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Pusch et  al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Rychkov et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Ludewig et al.,  1997</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Pusch and Jentsch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Foskett,  1998</xref>) our finding that they also show the same basic  subconductance behavior further supports the idea  that these two channels share similar structure&#x02013;function relationships.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al. (1998)</xref> suggested that ClC-1  has only one pore and supported this hypothesis with  measurements of the effect on macroscopic currents of  various channel-modifying reagents in homo- and heteromeric ClC-1 mutant constructs. With the assumption that the reagents act by a pore-blocking mechanism, they interpret their results as incompatible with a  channel structure with two physically distinct conduction pathways. This conclusion would be hard to extend to ClC-0 channels, for which the evidence for the  presence of two physically distinct conduction pathways, based on mutagenesis and single-channel recordings, is very strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Middleton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ludewig et al.,  1996</xref>).</p><p>Almost symmetric subconductance states have also  been observed in other channel types that are definitively single-barreled channels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Root and MacKinnon, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Root and MacKinnon (1994)</xref> observed independent protonation of two identical sites that led to  the appearance of binomially distributed subconductance states in a cyclic nucleotide&#x02013;gated cation (CNG)  channel. Such a mechanism is similar to the interpretation of ClC-1 gating as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D, even though  the gating of the CNG channel is different from ClC-0/ ClC-1 gating in at least two aspects: (a) the subconductance states in the CNG channel are not equidistant  and (b) the lowest conductance state with an open  &#x0201c;common&#x0201d; gate is not zero in the CNG channel. Most  importantly, however, the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Middleton et al.  (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ludewig et al. (1996)</xref> for ClC-0 are extremely difficult to explain on the basis of a channel  with a single pore: in these studies, the conductance,  ion selectivity, and gating properties of single protopores could be altered independently from the other  protopore, resulting in heteromeric asymmetric double-barreled channels in which the properties of the  two protopores were identical to those of the respective  homomeric parent channels.</p><p>On the other hand, we argue that the results of  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al. (1998)</xref> for ClC-1 can also be easily interpreted in the framework of a double-barreled channel.  First, it has not been ruled out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al. (1998)</xref>  that the reagents used in their study decrease the macroscopic current amplitude not by a pore-blocking  mechanism, but by acting on the gating of the channel.  In the voltage-dependent sodium channel, for example, amino acids of the &#x0201c;S4 segment&#x0201d; that probably do  not contribute to the pore are accessible to cysteine-modifying reagents, and their modification leads to  persistent changes in gating properties (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Yang et al.,  1997</xref>). The fact that some of the cysteine substitutions,  used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al. (1998)</xref> to make the channels sensitive to the modifying reagents, do per se modify drastically the macroscopic currents mediated by ClC-1, suggests that this could indeed be the case. If, for example,  the effect of the cysteine substitution is on the common  gate, it is plausible that the ulterior modification produced by the binding of MTSES [sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate] (or other reagents)  forces this gate into a closed conformation. This would  explain the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Fahlke et al. (1998)</xref>, which would  then be fully compatible with a double-barreled model.  In addition, even accepting the pore-blockage assumption, it could be that the two pores of the channel have  common intracellular and/or extracellular vestibules  and that the modifying reagents act by blocking in  these regions the entrance to both pores simultaneously.</p><p>In conclusion, our present data demonstrate that single ClC-1 channels behave like ClC-0 channels. Therefore, considering that the basic molecular structure of  both channels is similar and, in the absence of more  compelling evidence to the contrary, we maintain our  preference for the idea that both channels are characterized by a double-barreled structure with two identical and physically distinct conduction pathways. In fact,  we think that future observations will likely establish  the notion of the double barrel as a distinctive common motif of the structure of all ClC channels, some of  which have functional properties that are very poorly  understood except for their involvement in hereditary  diseases like kidney stone diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Lloyd et al., 1996</xref>)  and Bartter's syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Simon et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Possible kinetic schemes and models describing ClC-1  gating.
