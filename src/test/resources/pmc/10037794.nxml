To explore the function of myosin phosphatase in cell division, the possibility that myosin phosphatase activity  may be altered during cell division was examined. We  have found that the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT) undergoes mitosis-specific phosphorylation and that the phosphorylation is reversed during cytokinesis. MYPT phosphorylated either in vivo or in  vitro in the mitosis-specific way showed higher binding  to myosin II (two- to threefold) compared to MYPT  from cells in interphase. Furthermore, the activity of  myosin phosphatase was increased more than twice and  it is suggested this reflected the increased affinity of  myosin binding. These results indicate the presence of a  unique positive regulatory mechanism for myosin phosphatase in cell division. The activation of myosin phosphatase during mitosis would enhance dephosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain, thereby leading  to the disassembly of stress fibers during prophase. The  mitosis-specific effect of phosphorylation is lost on exit  from mitosis, and the resultant increase in myosin phosphorylation may act as a signal to activate cytokinesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>myosin binding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>A<sc>t</sc> mitosis, normal animal cultured cells show profound  reorganization of the microfilament cytoskeleton.  During prophase, both stress fibers and focal adhesions are disassembled, resulting in cell rounding. At cytokinesis, microfilaments form a contractile ring that contracts to generate daughter cells. During postmitotic cell  spreading, microfilaments reassemble into stress fibers  and focal adhesions are formed. The molecular mechanisms underlying these drastic alterations in the microfilament organization during cell division are largely unknown.</p><p>Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin  II (RMLC)<sup>1</sup> is thought to regulate actomyosin contractility  in smooth muscle and in many nonmuscle cells (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Kamm and Stull, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Moussavi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Somlyo  and Somlyo, 1994</xref>). RMLC is phosphorylated by myosin  light chain kinase at two sites, a primary site, Ser 19, and a  secondary site, Thr 18. It can also be phosphorylated (for  example by protein kinase C) at Ser 1 or Ser 2, and Thr 9.  In vitro, the phosphorylation at Ser 19 activates actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Sellers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Trybus,  1991</xref>) whereas phosphorylation at Ser 1/2 and Thr 9 can inhibit ATPase activity of myosin phosphorylated at Ser 19  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bengur et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Ikebe and Reardon, 1990</xref>). In vivo,  phosphorylation of Ser 19 is correlated with a variety of  contractile processes including smooth muscle contraction  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Sellers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Trybus, 1991</xref>), contraction of cultured cells  upon serum stimulation or treatment with certain drugs  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Giuliano et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Kolodney and Elson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Goeckeler and Wysolmerski, 1995</xref>), stress fiber assembly upon  serum stimulation of starved 3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chrzanowska-Wodnicka and Burridge, 1996</xref>), and cytokinesis of higher  eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Yamakita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Post et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">DeBiasio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matsumura  et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Previously, it was demonstrated that during cell division  the sites of phosphorylation on RMLC changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Satterwhite et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Yamakita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Totsukawa et al.,  1996</xref>). The major phosphorylation site of interphase cells  is Ser 19. When cells enter mitosis, Ser 19 is no longer  phosphorylated, but Ser 1/2 become the major phosphorylation sites. During cytokinesis, Ser 1/2 phosphorylation is  switched back to Ser 19, and Ser 19 phosphorylation persists during postmitotic cell spreading, suggesting that Ser  19 phosphorylation may activate contractile rings and is  required for stress fiber reassembly. These biochemical  studies are consistent with the observations that myosin II  phosphorylated on Ser 19 localized in cleavage furrows  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Post et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">DeBiasio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matsumura et al.,  1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Murata-Hori et al., 1998</xref>). Further, mutational analysis of a <italic>Drosophila spaghetti squash</italic> gene encoding RMLC  revealed that phosphorylation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> RMLC on  Ser 21 (which corresponds to Ser 19 of vertebrate RMLC)  is essential for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jordan and Karess, 1997</xref>). A  notable exception is myosin II of <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>, where heavy chain phosphorylation, but not light  chain phosphorylation, is critical for the regulation of its  cell motility and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Uyeda and Spudich, 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hammer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Ostrow et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of RMLC at Ser 19 is controlled by the  balance of two enzymatic activities, i.e., myosin light chain  kinase(s) and myosin phosphatase. While recent efforts  have focused on the functions of myosin phosphatase in  the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, the functions  of myosin phosphatase in nonmuscle cell motility are unclear. A trimeric myosin phosphatase is accepted as the  major protein phosphatase that is responsible for dephosphorylation of RMLC in smooth muscle and perhaps in  nonmuscle cells (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>).  The holoenzyme consists of three subunits: a large subunit  of &#x0223c;130 kD, a catalytic subunit of 38 kD, and a small subunit of 20 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alessi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Shimizu et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Shirazi et al., 1994</xref>). The catalytic subunit is the &#x003b4; isoform  of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1c&#x003b4;). The small subunit  may be a regulatory subunit, but its function is unclear.  The large subunit is known as the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT) also referred to as M130/133  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Shimizu et al., 1994</xref>), M110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1994</xref>), or myosin  binding subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Okubo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>).  MYPT can bind to both the catalytic subunit and myosin,  and thus will target the substrate, myosin, with the phosphatase. Without MYPT, PP1c showed low phosphatase  activity toward myosin, indicating a critical role of MYPT  in myosin dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alessi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hirano  et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Recently there have been several reports that phosphorylation of MYPT may modulate phosphatase activity. Initially, it was found that incubation of &#x003b1;-toxin permeabilized rabbit portal vein with ATP&#x003b3;S caused inhibition of  phosphatase activity and concomitant thiophosphorylation of MYPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 1995</xref>). Next it was  shown that MYPT was phosphorylated by an unknown kinase copurified in the phosphatase holoenzyme preparations from smooth muscle and that this phosphorylation  inhibited phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ichikawa et al., 1996</xref>). The  major site of phosphorylation of MYPT was T654 or T695  for the M130 and M133 MYPT isoforms, respectively.  Subsequently, Rho-kinase was shown to phosphorylate  MYPT in the COOH-terminal region and this phosphorylation inhibited phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>).  It is known that Rho A is involved in the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensitization process in smooth muscle (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Somlyo and  Somlyo, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>) and the possibility  that this is due to inhibition of myosin phosphatase via  phosphorylation of MYPT by Rho-kinase is attractive  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Uehata et al., 1997</xref>). It has also been suggested that a similar mechanism of phosphatase inhibition could initiate activation of contractile rings during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Amano et  al., 1996</xref>). Finally, the in vitro phosphorylation of MYPT  in its COOH-terminal region by protein kinase A resulted  in a decreased binding to acidic phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Ito et al.,  1997</xref>). This observation led to the hypothesis that within  the cell, binding of MYPT to the cell membrane may be  regulated by cAMP.</p><p>The changes in the phosphorylation states of RMLC  during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Satterwhite et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Yamakita et  al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Totsukawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matsumura et al., 1998</xref>)  suggest the presence of regulatory mechanisms of RMLC  phosphorylation that involve kinases and/or phosphatases.  Based on the above discussion, it was thought that one  reasonable possibility was the phosphorylation of MYPT  and modification of myosin phosphatase activity. In this  paper, we demonstrate that MYPT is phosphorylated in a  mitosis-specific way. Unlike phosphorylation by other kinases reported so far, the mitosis-specific phosphorylation  provides a positive regulatory effect on phosphatase activity. Phosphorylated MYPT shows an increased myosin  binding ability, resulting in the activation of phosphatase  during mitosis. Such activation would increase the dephosphorylation of RMLC and thus promote the disassembly  of stress fibers during prophase. The mitosis-specific modifications, i.e., phosphorylation of MYPT and activation of  phosphatase activity, are lost as the cell enters cytokinesis.  The reduced level of phosphatase activity may then lead to  increased myosin phosphorylation and activation of contractile rings.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>SV-40 transformed rat embryo cells (REF-2A) were maintained in DME  containing 10% newborn calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and  95% air at 37&#x000b0;C.

Rat MYPT was immunoprecipitated  from mitotic or interphase cells using Ab<sub>1&#x02013;296</sub> with buffer I, and eluted  from the Sepharose beads by incubating for 2 min with 0.1 M glycine, pH  2.3, containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA, followed by immediate neutralization with  2 M Tris base. The eluted MYPT was mixed with phosphorylated myosin  (0.1 &#x003bc;M) in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml  BSA, and 0.5 mM ATP.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid and BSA to final concentrations of 10% and  3 mg/ml, respectively. After centrifugation, the radioactivities of the supernatants were determined by Cerenkov counting. The reaction time was  adjusted so that &#x0223c;10&#x02013;20% of the substrate was dephosphorylated. In  some experiments, the gizzard myosin phosphatase was used to examine  effects of phosphorylation on myosin phosphatase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Other Procedures</title><p>Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping was performed using  cellulose thin layer plates as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Boyle et al.

As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a shows, the mAb did  not detect a band in the total cell lysates of mitotic cells  (lane 4) but the same mAb reacted strongly with MYPT  from interphase cells (lane 3). The lack of reactivity in mitotic cell lysates was not due to degradation of MYPT during mitosis because the pAb, Ab<sub>1&#x02013;38</sub>, reacted equally well  with MYPT from either interphase (lane 1) or mitotic  (lane 2) cells. In addition, in cells rounded by trypsin treatment the reactivity of MYPT with the mAb was retained  (data not shown). Thus it is suggested that the loss of recognition of the mAb for MYPT was due to a modification  of MYPT incurred during mitosis. </p><p>One possibility was that the lack of reactivity to the  mAb was due to mitosis-specific phosphorylation. To test  this idea, mitotic and interphase MYPT were immunoprecipitated, and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was  used as a control and the other was incubated with PP1c&#x003b1;.  The phosphatase treatment completely restored the reactivity of mitotic MYPT with the mAb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b; compare  lanes 2 and 4 of the upper panel), indicating that the lack  of reactivity to the mAb is due to mitosis-specific phosphorylation. It should also be noted that MYPT from mitotic cells showed a subtle but significant upward shift of  mobility on SDS-PAGE (compare lanes 1 and 2 of the  lower panel), and that the same phosphatase treatment  eliminated this shift (see lanes 2 and 4 of the lower panel).  In contrast, incubation with phosphatase of MYPT from  interphase cells did not affect its reactivity with the mAb  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b; compare lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate  that serine/threonine phosphorylation is responsible for  the mitosis-specific modification of MYPT.</p><p>Next, a time course of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation during cell division was examined. Total cell lysates  were prepared from interphase cells, mitotic cells, and  cells at different stages of cell division (see Materials and  Methods). MYPT was analyzed in each preparation by immunoblotting using the same mAb and pAb. Immunoblots  with the mAb clearly demonstrated that a mitosis-specific  phosphorylation of MYPT occurred and was dependent  on the cell cycle stage. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> c (upper panel) shows, mitotic MYPT (lane M) exhibited complete loss of reactivity  against the mAb, whereas interphase MYPT (lane I)  showed a strong reaction to the same antibody. The lack of  reactivity continued until 40 min after release of mitotic  arrest and then was recovered at 60 min, at which point cytokinesis occurred. At later phases when the cell was involved in postmitotic spreading (80&#x02013;180 min), the reactivity of MYPT to the mAb was similar to that of interphase  cells.</p><p>The lack of reactivity to the mAb parallels the mobility  shift observed with the pAb. An immunoblot with the  pAb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> c, lower panel) reveals that MYPT showed a  slight upward shift in mobility during mitosis (compare  lanes I and M). The upward shift was apparent until 40  min and then was reversed at 60 min. These results again  indicate that MYPT was dephosphorylated during cytokinesis. We have also observed similar modifications of  MYPT during mitosis of other cells including CHO cells  (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The Sites of Mitosis-specific Phosphorylation Differ  from Those Observed during Interphase</title><p>To examine whether net phosphate incorporation into  MYPT was increased during mitosis, MYPT was immunoprecipitated from interphase and mitotic cells after in vivo  labeling with <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> a shows, the  level of phosphorylation of mitotic MYPT (lane 2) is similar to that of interphase MYPT (lane 1). One explanation  for the lack of reactivity to the mAb could be that different sites were phosphorylated in the two stages, rather  than a net increase in phosphorylation during mitosis. </p><p>To examine this possibility, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed. MYPT was again immunoprecipitated from mitotic and interphase cells labeled in  vivo with <sup>32</sup>P-orthophosphate, digested with trypsin, and  analyzed by peptide mapping. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b shows the phosphopeptide maps generated with interphase (I) and mitotic  (M) MYPT. To identify which spots are mitosis-specific, a  mixture of mitotic and interphase MYPT samples was subjected to peptide mapping (Mix). The map of mitotic  MYPT (M) revealed four mitosis-specific phosphopeptide  spots (indicated by M1&#x02013;4). In addition, one spot (M5)  showed a considerably higher intensity in mitotic MYPT.  On the other hand, the interphase map (I) gives two interphase-specific spots (indicated by I). There are four spots  (indicated by C) which were observed commonly in both  mitotic and interphase MYPT maps. These results demonstrate that the sites of phosphorylation were different between mitotic and interphase MYPT. We also examined  the phosphopeptide pattern of MYPT prepared from cells  at 120 min after the release of mitotic arrest. This pattern  was identical to that shown with interphase cells (data not  shown). This is consistent with the result that the reactivity  of MYPT to the mAb at 120 min was similar to that of  MYPT from interphase cells.</p></sec><sec><title>In Vitro Reconstitution of Mitosis-specific  Phosphorylation MYPT</title><p>To further characterize mitosis-specific phosphorylation,  an attempt was made to reconstitute the mitosis-specific  phosphorylation in vitro. Mitotic <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts  were used as a kinase fraction. MYPT was immunoprecipitated from interphase cultured rat cells using buffer I, and  aliquoted into two. One-half was incubated with mitotic  <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts in the presence of Mg-ATP. As a control, the other half was incubated with interphase <italic>Xenopus</italic>  extracts that had been prepared from mitotic extracts following the addition of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (which converted mitotic  extracts into interphase extracts; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Murray, 1991</xref> and  Materials and Methods). The incubation with the mitotic  extracts eliminated the reactivity of MYPT against the  mAb (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> c, upper panel, lane 2). At the same time, the  mobility of MYPT showed an upward shift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> c, lower  panel, lane 2) when compared with the mobility of untreated MYPT (lane 1). In contrast, incubation with the interphase extracts did not alter the reactivity to the mAb  nor did it induce the mobility shift (lane 3). These results  suggest that <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extracts are able to reconstitute the mitosis-specific phosphorylation.</p><p>To confirm the reconstitution of MYPT, the phosphorylation sites of MYPT were analyzed by two-dimensional  phosphopeptide mapping. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> d, the  phosphopeptide map of MYPT phosphorylated in vitro by  mitotic <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (X) was similar to that phosphorylated in vivo in mitotic cells (compare M, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> b).  For comparison, a mixture of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylated MYPT was subjected to phosphopeptide mapping  (Mix, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> d). The map of MYPT phosphorylated by <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extracts showed four (M1&#x02013;3, M5) out of the  five mitotic-specific spots, although two interphase specific  spots (I) appeared simultaneously. The spot M4 could be  seen only after prolonged exposure of the autoradiograph  (data not shown). On the other hand, MYPT phosphorylated by interphase extracts yielded a map similar to that  of interphase MYPT (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a Mitosis-specific Phosphorylation Site</title><p>The loss of reactivity to the mAb indicated that the  epitope of the mAb may contain a site of mitosis-specific  phosphorylation. It was known that the epitope to the  mAb was between residues 371 and 511 (Hartshorne, D.J.,  unpublished results) and to define more precisely the  epitope a series of truncation mutants was analyzed. In  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a it is shown that fragment 421&#x02013;511 has a positive reaction with the mAb while 432&#x02013;511 was negative, indicating that the epitope is localized between residues 421 and  432. There are two serines (no threonine) in this sequence,  Ser 427 and Ser 430 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b), and these two residues were  mutated to Asp and Glu, respectively. The resultant point  mutants were expressed in bacteria, and the reactivities of  these two mutants to the mAb were examined by immunoblotting. It was found that mutation of Ser 430 to Glu  (S430E) resulted in complete loss of reactivity (lane 3 of  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> c). In contrast, the mutant replacing Ser 427 with  Asp (S427D) still showed a strong reactivity to the mAb,  though the reactivity was weaker than the control (lane 2  of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> c). A reasonable conclusion from these results is  that Ser 430 of MYPT is a site phosphorylated during mitosis, although it is possible that simultaneous phosphorylation at Ser 427 may also occur. </p><p>To further test whether Ser 430 is one of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, a peptide containing Ser 430  (from residues 421&#x02013;442 of rat MYPT) was synthesized and  phosphorylated in vitro using <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extracts.  The peptide was digested with trypsin and subjected to  two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. A map from  the phosphorylated synthetic peptide (P, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> d) yielded  several spots, apparently due to incomplete trypsin digestion (the peptide has multiple lysine and arginine residues). To examine whether any of these spots matched the  mitotic spots, the map generated from the phosphorylated  synthetic peptide was compared with a map from MYPT  phosphorylated with <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (X), and with a  map of a mixture from the peptide and MYPT samples  (Mix). It was found that two major spots (indicated by arrows) of the map generated from the synthetic peptide  correspond to two mitotic spots, M2 and M3. These results, together with the mutational analyses, indicate that  the spots, M2 and M3, are derived from mitosis-specific  phosphorylation at Ser 430. Again, there is the possibility  that Ser 427 may also be phosphorylated. It should be  noted that there are other mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites corresponding to the mitotic spots of M1, M4,  and M5.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased Myosin Binding Ability of Mitotic MYPT and Higher Phosphatase Activity Shown by  Mitotic Myosin Phosphatase</title><p>To explore the functional significance of mitosis-specific  phosphorylation of MYPT, the myosin binding activities  of MYPT from mitotic or interphase cells were compared.  Mitotic and interphase MYPT were immuno-affinity purified, and their myosin binding abilities were examined using phosphorylated myosin in the presence of Mg-ATP, as  described in Materials and Methods. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> a shows, the  amount of mitotic MYPT bound to phosphorylated myosin was about threefold higher than MYPT from interphase cells. </p><p>Because the quantity of MYPT isolated from mitotic  cells was limited, the in vitro reconstitution system was  used to prepare mitotic and interphase MYPT, allowing a  more extensive evaluation of the myosin-binding properties of MYPT, i.e., to use a wider range of MYPT concentrations. Rat MYPT immunoprecipitates (using buffer I)  were phosphorylated by either mitotic or interphase extracts, as described above, and then MYPT was eluted  from the immunocomplexes. Varying concentrations of  eluted MYPT (2&#x02013;25 nM) were mixed with phosphorylated  myosin in the presence of Mg-ATP and their binding was  examined. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> b shows, the amount of MYPT bound  to phosphorylated myosin was two to three times higher  using MYPT phosphorylated with mitotic extracts compared to the MYPT phosphorylated by interphase extracts. At 25 nM MYPT, it was found that &#x0223c;68% of MYPT  phosphorylated by mitotic extracts bound to myosin while  only 31% of MYPT phosphorylated by interphase extracts  bound to myosin. These results support the data obtained  for in vivo phosphorylation of MYPT (compare with  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> a).</p><p>The enhanced myosin binding activity of mitotic MYPT  suggested that myosin phosphatase activity may be increased during mitosis. To test this possibility, MYPT was  immunoprecipitated using buffer II (to retain the catalytic  subunit in complex with MYPT), phosphorylated with either <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic or interphase extracts, and used to  assay phosphatase activities. Again, the MYPT phosphorylated with <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extracts showed loss of reactivity to the mAb (lane 2 of the upper panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a), indicating that mitosis-specific phosphorylation of MYPT  occurred. It was also confirmed, by immunoblotting with  the pAb against MYPT and with the mAb to PP1c (middle  and lower panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a), that essentially identical  amounts of MYPT and the catalytic subunit were present  in the immunoprecipitates treated with mitotic or interphase <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts. As Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b shows, the myosin  phosphatase treated with mitotic extracts had approximately twice the activity than that treated with interphase  extracts. Similar results were obtained with chick gizzard  myosin phosphatase (data not shown). These results indicate that the enhanced myosin binding ability was accompanied by a higher phosphatase activity. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper we have demonstrated that MYPT is phosphorylated in a mitosis-specific way, and that phosphorylation increases its myosin binding ability, as well as myosin  phosphatase activity. The activation of myosin phosphatase by mitosis-specific phosphorylation is unique as  it provides a positive regulatory mechanism for myosin  phosphatase distinct from previous reports on phosphorylation of MYPT. For example, phosphorylation by Rho-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>) or by endogenous kinase  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ichikawa et al., 1996</xref>) was reported to inhibit the activity  of myosin phosphatase. Phosphorylation by protein kinase  A was found to decrease the association of MYPT with  lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Ito et al., 1997</xref>), which was suggested as a mechanism to regulate association of MYPT with membranes.  Activation of myosin phosphatase via the cGMP-dependent protein kinase has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Wu et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Lee et al., 1997</xref>) but the mechanism of activation has not  been established.</p><sec><title>Mechanism of Activation of Myosin Phosphatase by  Mitosis-specific Phosphorylation</title><p>Ser 430 (which corresponds to Ser 435 in rat MYPT) was  identified as one of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation  sites. It should be noted that the sequence surrounding Ser  430 is well conserved among different species including  human, rat, and chicken, although Ser 430 is changed to  Thr 435 in humans (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>).  In fact, chicken and rat MYPT have an identical sequence  of 42 amino acids around this phosphorylation site. There  are two genes that express MYPT, denoted MYPT1 and  MYPT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Takahashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Fujioka et al., 1998</xref>). The  isoform examined in this article is MYPT1, and MYPT2 is  found in heart and brain. The putative mitosis-specific  phosphorylation site also is found in MYPT2 at Ser 437.  The sequence around this site, 428&#x02013;447 of MYPT2 is 90%  identical to 421&#x02013;440 of MYPT1. Thus, it is possible that  phosphorylation of this site on MYPT is a general mechanism for activation of myosin phosphatase activity. It is interesting that Ser 430 does not have a consensus sequence  for cdc2 kinase. Although cdc2 kinase can phosphorylate  MYPT in vitro, a phosphopeptide pattern generated by  cdc2 is different from the peptide map of MYPT phosphorylated in vivo during mitosis (data not shown). Likewise, NIM A kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Pu et al., 1995</xref>) does not seem to be  responsible because a phosphopeptide map generated by  NIM A kinase is quite different from the mitotic pattern  (data not shown). Clearly, identification of the kinase responsible for the mitosis-dependent phosphorylation is a  priority for future studies.</p><p>It is not clear at present how mitotic phosphorylation influences the binding of MYPT to myosin. One of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, Ser 430 (Ser 427 may  be phosphorylated simultaneously) is located toward the  middle of the MYPT molecule. There is controversy regarding the location of the myosin-binding sites on MYPT.  It has been reported that the ankyrin repeats at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal portion of MYPT are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hirano et al.,  1997</xref>) and also that a COOH-terminal sequence is implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Johnson et al., 1997</xref>). Neither part of the molecule  is close (in terms of linear sequence) to Ser 430. Therefore,  a direct influence of Ser 430 on either of the putative myosin-binding sequences is not possible unless the MYPT  molecule bends, or folds, to accommodate such an interaction. It is possible that other mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites on MYPT may be close to one of the myosin  binding sites and contribute to the myosin-binding effect.  Alternatively, phosphorylation of Ser 430 may induce a  longer-range conformational change at the myosin-binding site. Clearly, the solution to this problem requires the  identification of all of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation  sites as well as the region(s) of MYPT involved in interaction with myosin.</p><p>It has been reported that cdc2 kinase phosphorylates  PP1c, and that phosphorylation inhibits its activity toward  phosphorylase <italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dohadwala et al., 1994</xref>). This seems to  be contradictory to the results presented here. However,  PP1c is involved in the dephosphorylation of several proteins, and the activity toward each protein is dependent on  various targeting molecules. For example, the activity of  PP1c toward phosphorylase <italic>a</italic> is considerably decreased in  the presence of MYPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alessi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Johnson et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>). The presence of target molecules may also affect the accessibility of PP1c for phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase. It is thus possible that phosphorylation of PP1c by cdc2 kinase may not inhibit myosin  phosphatase activity during mitosis. This is based on the  following two reasons. First, an activation of myosin phosphatase, rather than inhibition, was found following phosphorylation with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b). If  phosphorylation of PP1c by cdc2 kinase and resultant inhibition was a dominant mechanism it should have been detected in these experiments. Second, the phosphorylation  of PP1c of chick myosin phosphatase by <italic>Xenopus</italic> mitotic  extracts was not observed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Significance</title><p>Mitosis-specific phosphorylation of MYPT may play a significant role in the regulation of microfilament reorganization during cell division of cultured cells. The enhanced  myosin phosphatase activity would increase the probability for dephosphorylation of RMLC during prophase,  leading to the disassembly of stress fibers and cell rounding. This notion is consistent with our previous results  showing that Ser 19 phosphorylation is decreased when  cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Yamakita et al., 1994</xref>). The increased  activity of myosin phosphatase and resultant disassembly  of stress fibers also are compatible with the localization of  MYPT during mitosis. MYPT was reported to show a diffuse localization during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Ito et al., 1997</xref>) while it is  associated with microfilament structures such as stress fibers and adhesion belts during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Inagaki et al.,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Murata et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the reversal of mitosis-specific phosphorylation, i.e., dephosphorylation, during cytokinesis negates  the activation of myosin phosphatase and thus would favor  a higher level of Ser 19 phosphorylation for the activation  of contractile rings. This idea again is consistent with previous results in that the phosphorylation sites on RMLC  change from S1/2 to Ser 19 during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Satterwhite  et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Yamakita et al., 1994</xref>). This is supported by  our recent immunolocalization data using a Ser 19 phosphorylation specific antibody, in which prometaphase cells  showed a lower level of Ser 19 phosphorylation than cells  at telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matsumura et al., 1998</xref>). These changes in  phosphatase activity would explain a previous observation  by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fishkind et al. (1991)</xref> that microinjection of a catalytic  fragment of MLCK (constitutively active MLCK) delayed  the onset of anaphase but did not alter the rate of progression of cytokinesis. Perhaps, the increased activity of myosin phosphatase during prometaphase could counteract  phosphorylation of Ser 19 by the catalytic fragment of  MLCK before cytokinesis. The decrease in myosin phosphatase activity during cytokinesis would then be able to  regulate cleavage furrow contraction. If these speculations  are correct, then the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of  MYPT may play a pivotal role in the control of cell division.</p><p>The positive regulatory mechanism of myosin phosphatase described above contrasts the negative regulation  by phosphorylation of MYPT with Rho-kinase. It is possible that both mechanisms collaborate to regulate the massive reorganization of microfilaments during cell division.  Our current model for regulation of myosin phosphatase  during cell division is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. This incorporates  two phosphorylation steps: an activation via the mitosis-specific kinase(s), and an inhibition via Rho-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Amano  et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kimura et al., 1996</xref>). It is therefore reasonable  to suggest that there are at least two functional phosphorylation sites to reflect the positive and negative regulatory  effects. When cells enter prophase it is proposed that the  mitosis-specific phosphorylation occurs (via unknown kinase) and this causes activation of myosin phosphatase  and a decrease in the level of myosin phosphorylation (at  Ser 19). The result is disassembly of stress fibers and cell  rounding. On exit from mitosis and before, or during cytokinesis, the activating site(s) on MYPT are dephosphorylated. At the same phase of the cell cycle it is suggested  that inhibition of myosin phosphatase occurs via phosphorylation of MYPT by Rho-kinase. Here the next result  would be an increase in the level of myosin phosphorylation (at Ser 19) and activation of myosin for cell division.  There are important components of this scheme that must  be identified before a plausible mechanism can be established, these include the kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) involved at the mitosis-specific stage. </p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mitosis-specific phosphorylation of MYPT.

(a) Schematic presentation of the truncated  mutants of chick MYPT. The reactivities to the mAb of truncated  mutants are shown. MYPT truncated mutants were immunoblotted with the mAb against MYPT. The protein expression in bacteria was confirmed with an antipolyhistidine antibody. The  epitope of the mAb should be located between 421 and 432. (b)  The epitope region of MYPT to the mAb. The sequence shown is  Glu 421 to Arg 432 of chick MYPT (which corresponds to Glu  426 to Arg 437 of rat MYPT), and contains two serine residues of  Ser 427 and Ser 430. To mimic phosphorylation, Ser 427 and Ser  430 were mutated to Asp (S427D) and Glu (S430E), respectively,  and the mutants were expressed in bacteria. (c) Immunoblot  analysis of the phosphorylation-mimicking mutants of MYPT.  The S427D and S430E mutants were separated by SDS-PAGE  followed by immunoblotting analysis using the antipolyhistidine  antibody or the mAb against MYPT.
