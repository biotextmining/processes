Zheng,  B.M. Alberts, and K. Oegema. 1998. <italic>J. Cell Biol.</italic> 142:1&#x02013; 12). Here, we report the purification and characterization of both complexes that we name &#x003b3;-tubulin small  complex (&#x003b3;TuSC; &#x0223c;280,000 D) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC  (&#x0223c;2,200,000 D). In addition to &#x003b3;-tubulin, the &#x003b3;TuSC  contains Dgrip84 and Dgrip91, two proteins homologous to the Spc97/98p protein family. The &#x003b3;TuSC is a  structural subunit of the &#x003b3;TuRC, a larger complex containing about six additional polypeptides. Like the  &#x003b3;TuRC isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Zheng, Y.,  M.L. Wong, B. Alberts, and T. Mitchison. 1995. <italic>Nature.</italic>  378:578&#x02013;583), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC can nucleate microtubules in vitro and has an open ring structure with a  diameter of 25 nm. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals a  modular structure with &#x0223c;13 radially arranged structural  repeats. The &#x003b3;TuSC also nucleates microtubules, but  much less efficiently than the &#x003b3;TuRC, suggesting that  assembly into a larger complex enhances nucleating activity. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the &#x003b3;TuSC  reveals that &#x003b3;-tubulin binds preferentially to GDP over  GTP, rendering &#x003b3;-tubulin an unusual member of the tubulin superfamily.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>nucleation</kwd><kwd>GTP</kwd><kwd>GDP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>T<sc>he</sc> microtubule (MT)<sup>1</sup> cytoskeleton is essential for  cell division and organization of the interphase cytoplasm. These functions are orchestrated by diverse and highly dynamic MT arrays generated by a variety  of mechanisms including regulation of the polymerization  dynamics of MTs, of proteins that interact with and organize MTs, and of MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Desai and Mitchison,  1997</xref>). The latter mechanism is possible because the spontaneous nucleation of new tubulin polymers is kinetically  limiting, both in vitro when the polymerization of pure tubulin is initiated, and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alberts et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for a kinetic barrier to MT nucleation in vivo  comes from analysis of repolymerization of MTs after cold  treatment or treatment with anti-MT agents. In many animal cells, regrowth initiates from the pericentriolar material (PCM) that surrounds the centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Frankel, 1976</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Osborn and Weber, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Keryer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meads and  Schroer, 1995</xref>), demonstrating that the PCM promotes MT  nucleation. A major breakthrough in defining the molecular basis of the MT-nucleating activity of the PCM was the  discovery of &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Oakley and Oakley, 1989</xref>). &#x003b3;-tubulin is a member of the tubulin superfamily that localizes to  MT organizing centers and is found in all eukaryotes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Joshi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Pereira and Schiebel, 1997</xref>). Genetic  studies have demonstrated that &#x003b3;-tubulin is required for  normal cytoplasmic and spindle MT formation in <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Martin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Oakley et al.,  1990</xref>), <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Horio et al., 1991</xref>),  <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Sunkel et al., 1995</xref>), and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Sobel and Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Marschall et  al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Spang et al., 1996</xref>). Antibody inhibition experiments in vertebrates have also implicated &#x003b3;-tubulin in MT  nucleation by the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Joshi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Felix et  al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, soluble &#x003b3;-tubulin exists primarily  in a large complex (between 25 and 32 S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meads and Schroer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Detraves et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Moritz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Murphy et al.,  1998</xref>). Recently, this complex was purified from <italic>Xenopus</italic>  egg extracts and shown to nucleate MTs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng  et al., 1995</xref>). This complex, called the &#x003b3;TuRC (&#x003b3;-tubulin  ring complex), consists of about eight proteins in addition  to &#x003b3;-tubulin and has the appearance of an open ring with  approximately the same diameter as a MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al.,  1995</xref>). Rings of this diameter have also been observed in  the PCM of centrosomes isolated from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Moritz et al., 1995a</xref>) and the surf clam, <italic>Spisula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Vogel et al., 1997</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, immunoelectron microscopy has confirmed the presence of clusters of &#x003b3;-tubulin in  the ring structures and at the base of MTs nucleated by the  PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Moritz et al., 1995b</xref>). Cumulatively, these results  suggest that the &#x003b3;TuRC is a highly conserved structure responsible for the MT-nucleating activity of the PCM.</p><p>The &#x003b3;-tubulin in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the most divergent of all  &#x003b3;-tubulins. It is only &#x0223c;35&#x02013;40% identical to the other  known &#x003b3;-tubulins, all of which are at least 65% identical to  each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Marschall et al., 1996</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the  only known soluble &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complex is &#x0223c;6 S  and contains three proteins: &#x003b3;-tubulin, and two related  proteins, Spc97p and Spc98p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Geissler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Knop  et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>). Immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged proteins suggest that the <italic>S.  cerevisiae</italic> complex contains one molecule of Spc97p, one  molecule of Spc98p, and two or more molecules of &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Knop et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>). The yeast  &#x003b3;-tubulin 6 S complex is thought to be anchored to the cytoplasmic side of the spindle pole body through the interaction of Spc97p and Spc98p with Spc72p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Knop and  Schiebel, 1998</xref>), and to the nuclear side of the spindle  pole body through interaction with the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of  Spc110p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>). To date, in vitro MT-nucleating activity for the yeast complex has not been  demonstrated. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the  yeast &#x003b3;-tubulin complex nucleates MTs directly, or whether  it assembles into a larger, perhaps &#x003b3;TuRC-like structure  at the spindle pole body. Interestingly, homologues of  Spc97p and Spc98p in humans (hGCP2 and hGCP3/ HsSpc98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Murphy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tassin et al., 1998</xref>) and in  <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Xgrip109; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Martin et al., 1998</xref>) colocalize with  &#x003b3;-tubulin at the centrosome and cosediment with &#x003b3;-tubulin  on sucrose gradients, indicating that they are components  of the large &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes present in these  organisms.</p><p>Understanding the role of &#x003b3;-tubulin in MT nucleation is  a challenging endeavor. Low cellular concentrations make  purification from native sources difficult, and the complexity of the protein complexes that contain &#x003b3;-tubulin limits  expression-based studies. Analysis of MT nucleation is  further complicated by the following: the complex structure of the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wade and Chretien, 1993</xref>), the  large number of tubulin molecules potentially involved in  the formation of a nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Voter and Erickson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Fygenson et al., 1995</xref>), and the potential role of &#x003b2;-tubulin  GTP hydrolysis in suppressing nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Hyman et al.,  1992</xref>). This difficulty is reflected by the fact that the mechanism of spontaneous nucleation of purified tubulin remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Voter and Erickson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Fygenson et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Central to understanding the mechanism of MT nucleation by &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes will be to understand the relationship between &#x003b3;-tubulin and other members of the tubulin superfamily. One important aspect of  this relationship is the nature of the contacts &#x003b3;-tubulin  makes with itself and with &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-tubulin. A second important aspect is how &#x003b3;-tubulin compares to other members of the tubulin family in its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. If &#x003b3;-tubulin binds a guanine nucleotide, it will  be important to determine whether nucleotide exchange  and hydrolysis contribute to its ability to assemble, disassemble, nucleate, or release MTs, or whether the bound  nucleotide has a structural role, as is the case for &#x003b1;-tubulin.</p><p>In this paper, we begin to address the functional organization of the &#x003b3;TuRC by purifying and analyzing &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013; containing complexes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extracts.  In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two related &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing  complexes. The larger complex can be collapsed into the  smaller complex by treatment with high salt. This condensation suggests that the small complex is a structural subunit of the large complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Moritz et al., 1998</xref>). We purify  both complexes and show that the large <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex nucleates MTs much more potently than the small  complex. We also show that, in contrast to &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin which preferentially bind GTP, &#x003b3;-tubulin in the small  complex preferentially binds GDP.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Buffers and Reagents</title><p>HB: 50 mM K-Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (&#x003b2;-ME) and protease inhibitor stock (1:200 final dilution;  see below).

To obtain size estimates for each complex, we performed gel filtration and sucrose gradient sedimentation  under low salt conditions in buffers that were supplemented with magnesium and GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) to reduce aggregation that occurs in nucleotide-free buffers. Under  these conditions, the &#x003b3;TuSC has an S value of 9.8 and a  Stokes radius of 7.0 nm, while the &#x003b3;TuRC has an S value  of 35.5 S and a 15-nm Stokes radius.

For clarity, &#x003b3;TuSC  and &#x003b3;TuRC are shown side by side in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B. The protein  profile of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC is reminiscent of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). Therefore, by analogy to the  Xgrips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Martin et al., 1998</xref>), we name <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC  proteins Dgrips and designate them by their apparent molecular weights. Like the <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC, the <italic>Drosophila</italic>  &#x003b3;TuRC is composed of two high molecular mass proteins  (Dgrip163 and Dgrip128), two prominent proteins near  100 kD (Dgrip91 and Dgrip84), and a group of three or  four proteins with molecular masses near 75 kD (Dgrip75s).  The protein below &#x003b3;-tubulin (between the 56- and 38.5-kD markers) has been identified as actin. It is not clear  whether actin is a specific component of &#x003b3;TuRC, or if it  fortuitously copurifies. Depending on the purification protocol, varying amounts of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin copurify with  <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; Y.

Consistent with the idea that &#x003b3;TuSC is a structural subunit  of &#x003b3;TuRC, &#x003b3;TuSC is composed of the three most prominent proteins in &#x003b3;TuRC: &#x003b3;-tubulin, Dgrip84, and Dgrip91  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). </p></sec><sec><title>The Drosophila &#x003b3;TuRC Nucleates MTs In Vitro</title><p>To determine which of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;-tubulin complexes were able to nucleate MTs, we separated them by  sucrose gradient sedimentation and tested them using a  coverslip nucleation assay (outlined in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C). In this assay, the sample to be tested is allowed to bind to a preblocked coverslip, unbound protein is washed away, and  the coverslip is incubated with purified bovine brain tubulin containing a small amount of rhodamine-labeled tubulin. Unincorporated tubulin and spontaneously nucleated  MTs are removed by aspiration, whereas MTs nucleated  and tethered to the coverslip by the &#x003b3;-tubulin complexes  remain and are fixed and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Although this assay is not quantitative, it has two advantages over the conventional solution nucleation assay:  (a) the background of spontaneously nucleated MTs is removed by aspiration, allowing detection of very low levels  of &#x003b3;-tubulin dependent nucleation; (b) buffer components  are washed away before exposure to tubulin. The latter is  useful when directly assaying sucrose gradient fractions  because of the strong interfering effects of varying sucrose  concentrations on tubulin nucleation and elongation.</p><p>The results of a coverslip assay on the sucrose gradient  fractions in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D. The top two  rows are equivalent exposures for fractions 3&#x02013;14. The bottom row shows longer exposures (either 40&#x000d7; or 5&#x000d7; longer)  for the indicated fractions. We observe a clear peak of activity corresponding to the fractions that contain &#x003b3;TuRC  (fractions 10&#x02013;14). Under these conditions, no activity is  seen in the fractions containing &#x003b3;TuSC (fractions 4&#x02013;6).  Similar to the peptide-eluted complexes, gel filtration or  sucrose gradient&#x02013;fractionated <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extracts  tested in this assay show only one peak of activity, corresponding to the peak of &#x003b3;TuRC (data not shown). To distinguish between nucleation and capture of spontaneously  nucleated MTs, we performed the coverslip nucleation assay with peptide-eluted material and observed unfixed  samples in real time using video enhanced DIC microscopy (data not shown). MTs initiated at the coverslip surface and elongated, while maintaining a fixed orientation  with one end anchored to the coverslip. Capture of a MT  from solution by the surface was never observed.

To distinguish between these possibilities we developed a protocol to prepare more concentrated &#x003b3;TuSC,  taking advantage of the disruption of &#x003b3;TuRC into &#x003b3;TuSC  by high salt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). &#x003b3;TuRC was disrupted by isolating  &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes in the presence of 500  mM NaCl. The resulting &#x003b3;TuSC was eluted with peptide  containing buffer in 500 mM NaCl. The peptide-eluted  material was further fractionated on a 5&#x02013;20% sucrose gradient in 500 mM NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). This gradient separated  &#x003b3;TuSC from residual larger complexes and from non-&#x003b3;TuSC components of &#x003b3;TuRC. This resulted in highly  concentrated, relatively pure &#x003b3;TuSC (15 &#x003bc;l of each fraction was loaded on the gel in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A compared with 50 &#x003bc;l  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). Inclusion of 500 mM salt in the sucrose gradient was important to prevent any reassociation of &#x003b3;TuSC  with non&#x003b3;TuSC components of &#x003b3;TuRC. Typically, the  peak &#x003b3;TuSC sucrose gradient fraction contained &#x0223c;700  nM &#x003b3;-tubulin (as judged by densitometry of Coomassie-stained bands relative to &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin standards). For  comparison, after sucrose gradient fractionation, the  peak &#x003b3;TuSC-containing sucrose gradient fraction in the  mixed complex preparation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A) contained &#x0223c;70 nM  &#x003b3;-tubulin. </p><p>Concentrated &#x003b3;TuSC fractions were dialyzed to remove  salt and tested for nucleating activity. In contrast to the robust activity of the peptide-eluted complexes, nucleation  by isolated &#x003b3;TuSC in solution was weak and slightly variable between preparations. A direct comparison between  the nucleating activity of the peptide-eluted complexes  (containing 0.87 &#x003bc;M total &#x003b3;-tubulin, 0.65 &#x003bc;M &#x003b3;-tubulin in  &#x003b3;TuRC) and isolated &#x003b3;TuSC (0.74 &#x003bc;M &#x003b3;-tubulin) in a solution nucleation assay is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. In nucleation reactions containing between 350&#x02013;450 nM &#x003b3;-tubulin and 4  mg/ml tubulin, the nucleating activity of the peptide-eluted complexes was typically 80&#x02013;100-fold above the level  of spontaneous nucleation; under these conditions the  level of nucleation for isolated &#x003b3;TuSC was only two- to  threefold above background (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). Therefore, it is  likely that the nucleating activity of the peptide-eluted  complexes is due to primarily the activity of &#x003b3;-tubulin in  &#x003b3;TuRC. Based on those data, we estimate that per mole of  &#x003b3;-tubulin &#x003b3;TuRC is &#x0223c;25 times more active than &#x003b3;TuSC in  promoting nucleation. Since there are &#x0223c;12 &#x003b3;-tubulin molecules in &#x003b3;TuRC and only 2 in &#x003b3;TuSC (see below for stoichiometry estimates), &#x003b3;TuRC is &#x0223c;150 times more active  than &#x003b3;TuSC per mole of complex. We also tested the nucleating activity of &#x003b3;TuSC in the coverslip nucleation assay. The concentrated &#x003b3;TuSC was also able to nucleate  MTs in this assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). </p><p>The activity of &#x003b3;TuSC could be explained at least two  ways: (a) &#x003b3;TuSC might reassemble into a &#x003b3;TuRC-like  higher-order structure, or (b) &#x003b3;TuSC itself might have intrinsic nucleating activity. To begin distinguishing between  these possibilities, we examined dialyzed &#x003b3;TuSC for evidence of formation of higher-order structures using gel filtration chromatography. Undialyzed &#x003b3;TuSC migrated in a  position typical of that for the smaller complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C,  top).

The homology between the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins  and the other members of this family extends over the entire length of the proteins (data not shown). In comparisons of Dgrip84 and Dgrip91 with the corresponding  human proteins, a one-to-one correspondence emerges.  Dgrip84 is 32% identical (46% similar) to hGCP2 and  only 21% identical (32% similar) to hGCP3; in contrast,  Dgrip91 is 31% identical (45% similar) to hGCP3 and  only 24% identical (37% similar) to hGCP2. These results suggest that Dgrip84 and hGCP2, and Dgrip91 and  hGCP3 may be functionally homologous pairs.

After correcting for the predicted  molecular weight of each protein, we estimated that the  ratio of Dgrip91 to Dgrip84 to &#x003b3;-tubulin in the &#x003b3;TuSC is  1:1:2. Since our estimate of the molecular mass of purified  &#x003b3;TuSC from sucrose gradient sedimentation and gel filtration is 280,000 D (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>), we suspect that &#x003b3;TuSC contains 1 molecule of Dgrip91, 1 molecule of Dgrip84, and 2  molecules of &#x003b3;-tubulin.

To test this hypothesis, we raised  and affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize Dgrip84 and Dgrip91. Each antibody recognizes a  band of the expected molecular weight on Western blots  of embryo extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, left). As expected, both  Dgrip84 and Dgrip91 comigrate with &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC  and &#x003b3;TuRC when embryo extract is fractionated on sucrose gradients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, right). In addition, the localizations of Dgrip84 and Dgrip91 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos are  indistinguishable from that of &#x003b3;-tubulin. Each antibody  recognizes the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and  shows some spindle staining during mitosis with enrichment at the spindle poles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B), regardless of its cognate antigen. We propose that <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;-tubulin is stably associated with Dgrip91/84.

Thus, it is tempting to speculate  that &#x003b3;-tubulin can bind, and possibly hydrolyze, GTP. To  determine if &#x003b3;-tubulin binds guanine nucleotide, we immunoisolated &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes in the absence  of GTP. The isolated complexes, either before or after  sucrose gradient sedimentation, were incubated with  [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP and UV cross-linked. In the peptide-eluted  complexes, &#x003b3;-tubulin is the only protein that cross-links  to GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A). Furthermore, &#x003b3;-tubulin in both the  &#x003b3;TuRC and &#x003b3;TuSC cross-links to GTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B). Competition experiments showed that the cross-link can be competed by addition of excess cold GTP, GDP, and GTP&#x003b3;S  but not GMP-PNP, ATP, or CTP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> C). </p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC Preferentially Binds GDP</title><p>To characterize the nucleotide binding properties of  &#x003b3;-tubulin, we compared the nucleotide content of &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC to that of similarly treated &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer.  &#x003b3;TuSC was isolated in buffers containing either 20 &#x003bc;M  GDP or 20 &#x003bc;M GTP. To remove free nucleotide, we used  a rapid (within 45 s) microscale desalting procedure. For  comparison, pure &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer was diluted into a  buffer identical to that containing &#x003b3;TuSC and desalted in  parallel. Nucleotide was extracted from the desalted samples and analyzed by mono Q chromatography. To estimate the stoichiometry of bound nucleotide to protein,  the amount of &#x003b3;- and &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin in each desalted sample  was quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie-stained gel  bands relative to &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin standards, and the nucleotide  concentration was determined by peak integration and  comparison with nucleotide standards processed in an  identical fashion.</p><p>Each &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer has two guanine nucleotide  binding sites, one on each tubulin subunit. Exclusively  GTP is bound to &#x003b1;-tubulin at the nonexchangeable or  N-site; this nucleotide does not exchange with GTP/GDP  in solution and does not undergo hydrolysis. In contrast,  &#x003b2;-tubulin binds guanine nucleotide in an exchangeable  fashion at the E-site. Both GTP and GDP bind to the  E-site with GTP having a three- to fourfold higher affinity  than GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Zeeberg and Caplow, 1979</xref>). GTP bound to  the E-site does not undergo significant hydrolysis in the  absence of polymerization but gets hydrolyzed soon after  incorporation into the MT lattice, resulting in GDP that is  locked in the lattice and can only exchange after depolymerization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>).  These properties predict that if &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer is isolated from buffers containing GDP, then there will be 1  mol GTP (N-site) and 1 mol GDP (E-site) per mole of  &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer. In contrast, if &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer is isolated from buffers containing GTP, under conditions where  there is no polymerization, then there will be 2 mol GTP  (1 N-site GTP and 1 E-site GTP) per mole of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin  dimer. Consistent with these predictions, we recovered 1.1  mol of GTP and 0.8 mol GDP per mole of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin  dimer isolated from GDP buffer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, B and G, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>); in contrast, we recovered exclusively 2.0 mol of  GTP per mole of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer isolated from GTP  buffer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, E and G, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). These results establish the validity of our assay for comparing the nucleotide-binding properties of &#x003b3;TuSC to those of &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer.  </p><p>When &#x003b3;TuSC was similarly analyzed, the nucleotide recovered from &#x003b3;TuSC incubated in GDP buffers was exclusively GDP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C). Approximately 0.7 mol GDP was  recovered per mole of &#x003b3;-tubulin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> G and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).  The exclusive presence of GDP could be explained at least  three ways: (a) the guanine nucleotide binding site on  &#x003b3;-tubulin subunits of &#x003b3;TuSC is freely exchangeable; (b)  GDP is locked nonexchangeably into &#x003b3;-tubulin subunits of  &#x003b3;TuSC, analogous to GTP bound at the N-site in &#x003b1;-tubulin; or (c) GDP is locked nonexchangeably into &#x003b3;TuSC as  the product of earlier GTP hydrolysis, much like &#x003b2;-tubulin  bound GDP within the body of a polymerizing MT.</p><p>To distinguish between these possibilities, we isolated  &#x003b3;TuSC from GTP-containing buffer. Surprisingly, we recovered a greatly reduced amount of nucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> F).  Only 0.2 mol guanine nucleotide was recovered per mole  of &#x003b3;-tubulin, indicating that &#x0223c;80% of the &#x003b3;-tubulin was  empty at its nucleotide binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> G and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).  To ascertain that the GTP in the buffer had not been degraded, we removed an aliquot before desalting and analyzed its nucleotide content. This sample contained the expected amount of GTP and a trace amount of GDP (&#x0223c;3%  of total guanine nucleotide). This amount of GDP was also  recovered from a similarly processed control buffer, indicating that it did not arise from hydrolysis by &#x003b3;TuSC or a  contaminating GTPase (not shown). The low recovery of  guanine nucleotide bound to &#x003b3;TuSC isolated from GTP  buffer indicates that GDP is bound exchangeably to  &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC. This result also argues against the  theory that the GDP bound to &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC, isolated from GDP buffer, is being generated by earlier GTP  hydrolysis. The recovery of nearly 1 mol GDP per mole  of &#x003b3;-tubulin from GDP buffer and the nearly equivalent  amounts of GTP and GDP in the 0.2 mol nucleotide recovered per mole of &#x003b3;-tubulin from GTP buffer, despite a  GTP/GDP ratio &#x02265;30 before desalting, strongly suggest  that &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC has an exchangeable guanine nucleotide binding site that has a much higher affinity for  GDP than GTP. To test this further, we isolated &#x003b3;TuSC  in buffer containing 20 &#x003bc;M GTP and, 1 h before desalting,  added 20 &#x003bc;M GDP. Consistent with our interpretation, we  recovered 0.44 mol GDP and 0.02 mol GTP per &#x003b3;-tubulin  monomer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>&#x003b3;-tubulin Complexes in Eukaryotes</title><p>The &#x003b3;-tubulin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo extracts exists in two  related complexes of &#x0223c;280,000 (&#x003b3;TuSC) and 2,200,000 D  (&#x003b3;TuRC).

The  significance of this finding is not clear, but might reflect a  difference between &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes isolated from different organisms and cell types. Interestingly, &#x003b3;-tubulin in the polarized human intestinal epithelial  cell line Caco-2 was present in both 10 S and 29 S complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meads and Schroer, 1995</xref>). In Caco-2 cells, &#x003b3;-tubulin localizes both to centrosomes and to a diffuse layer beneath the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meads and Schroer, 1995</xref>).  However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of an apical layer of &#x003b3;-tubulin correlates with the existence of a  smaller 10 S complex. Further experiments will be required to determine if the differences in &#x003b3;-tubulin&#x02013;containing complexes present in cellular extracts are caused  by different extraction conditions, or if they reflect real diversity between systems and cell types in the nature and  function of &#x003b3;-tubulin complexes in vivo.</p><p>The protein profile of the purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC is  very similar to that of the previously purified <italic>Xenopus</italic>  &#x003b3;TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>).

In  addition to molecular similarities, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC  also resembles the <italic>Xenopus</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC in its structure (both  complexes appear as open rings when visualized by negative stain electron microscopy).</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b3;TuSC: a Conserved Subcomplex of the &#x003b3;TuRC</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuRC can be converted to &#x003b3;TuSC by treatment with high salt, suggesting that &#x003b3;TuSC is a structural  subunit of &#x003b3;TuRC. A similar dissociation by high salt  has been reported for human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> large &#x003b3;-tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Stearns and Kirschner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Meads and  Schroer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). The hypothesis that  &#x003b3;TuSC is a subunit of &#x003b3;TuRC is supported by our finding  that purified &#x003b3;TuSC is composed of the three proteins most  prominent in &#x003b3;TuRC: &#x003b3;-tubulin, Dgrip84, and Dgrip91.  Dgrip84 and Dgrip91 are members of the Spc97/98p family of proteins. This family includes hGCP2 and hGCP3/ HsSpc98p from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Murphy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tassin et al.,  1998</xref>) and Xgrip109 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Martin et al., 1998</xref>).  Homologous ESTs have also been identified in mouse, zebrafish, and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tassin et al., 1998</xref>). Genetic evidence in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> suggests that this family of  proteins interacts directly with &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Geissler et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Knop et al., 1997</xref>). Based on molecular weight estimates and densitometry of Coomassie stained gels, we  estimate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;TuSC is a heterotetrameric  complex containing one Dgrip84, one Dgrip91, and two  molecules of &#x003b3;-tubulin. This stoichiometry is identical to  the proposed composition of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> 6 S complex  (Sc &#x003b3;TuSC). Immunoprecipitation experiments with tagged  proteins indicate that Sc &#x003b3;TuSC contains one Spc97p, one  Spc98p, and two or more molecules of &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Knop et  al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>). Together, these  results support the hypothesis that the organization of  &#x003b3;-tubulin into &#x003b3;TuSC is likely to be conserved among all  organisms where &#x003b3;-tubulin is found. One question of fundamental importance that needs to be addressed in the future is how the two &#x003b3;-tubulin molecules within &#x003b3;TuSC are  arranged. Are they arranged in a head to tail dimer as  would be suggested by the model proposing that &#x003b3;TuRC  is a protofilament of &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Erickson and Stoffler,  1996</xref>), or are they arranged in a side-by-side configuration  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>)?</p><p>In metazoa, &#x003b3;TuSC is further assembled into &#x003b3;TuRC.  Based on our hydrodynamic analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> complexes, we estimate that &#x003b3;TuRC contains approximately  four to six &#x003b3;TuSCs. An exact determination awaits a more  accurate appraisal of the molecular weight of &#x003b3;TuRC, currently being attempted using scanning transmission electron microscopy. It will also be interesting to identify the  structural correlate of &#x003b3;TuSC within &#x003b3;TuRC. When viewed  by cryo-electron microscopy, &#x003b3;TuRC has a modular structure with &#x0223c;13 structural repeats organized in a radial symmetric pattern. Based on our current estimates, we speculate that one &#x003b3;TuSC might correspond to two of the radial  symmetric structural repeats visible by cryo-electron microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleation Activity of &#x003b3;TuSC and &#x003b3;TuRC</title><p>An important issue with respect to the in vivo roles of  &#x003b3;TuSC and &#x003b3;TuRC is their relative MT nucleating activity.  The fact that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does not appear to contain a  &#x003b3;TuRC-like complex raises the question of whether Sc  &#x003b3;TuSC has nucleating activity or whether it must assemble  into a larger structure at the spindle pole body to become  active. Conversely, in metazoa it is possible that &#x003b3;TuRC is  a storage form for &#x003b3;-tubulin and it could be &#x003b3;TuSC that  nucleates MTs at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>).  To begin to address this question, we compared the nucleating activity of peptide-eluted complexes (in which &#x0223c;75%  of &#x003b3;-tubulin is &#x003b3;TuRC) to isolated &#x003b3;TuSC at similar concentrations of &#x003b3;-tubulin. Using both solution and coverslip  nucleation assays, we found that both preparations had  nucleating activity. However, whereas the solution nucleating activity of the peptide-eluted complexes was robust,  typically 80&#x02013;100-fold above the level of spontaneous nucleation, under similar conditions the level of nucleation  for isolated &#x003b3;TuSC was only two- to threefold above background. Thus, per mole of &#x003b3;-tubulin &#x003b3;TuRC is &#x0223c;25 times  more active than &#x003b3;TuSC in promoting nucleation. Combining these data with our stoichiometry measurements,  we estimate that per mole of complex &#x003b3;TuRC is &#x0223c;150  times more active than &#x003b3;TuSC, suggesting that organization of &#x003b3;TuSC into &#x003b3;TuRC facilitates MT nucleation activity.</p><p>We emphasize that the nature of the nucleating activity  of &#x003b3;TuSC is still unclear. &#x003b3;TuSC may have intrinsic nucleating activity or it may need to assemble into larger  &#x003b3;TuRC-like complexes in order to nucleate MTs. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, high-salt dissociated &#x003b3;TuRC components can  be reassembled by desalting. This reassembly is blocked  by depleting Xgrip109, suggesting that intact &#x003b3;TuSC is required for assembly of &#x003b3;-tubulin into a &#x003b3;TuRC-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Martin et al., 1998</xref>). Here we separate &#x003b3;TuSC from  the remaining components of &#x003b3;TuRC and do not find any  evidence for assembly of larger structures after desalting.  This occurrence suggests that &#x003b3;TuSC is required but not  sufficient for assembly of a &#x003b3;TuRC-like structure. We cannot exclude the possibility that &#x003b3;TuSC, like &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin  dimer, assembles into larger complexes when the temperature is raised during nucleation assays. Because the level  of activity of &#x003b3;TuSC is very low compared to that of  &#x003b3;TuRC, we also cannot rule out the possibility that the nucleating activity of &#x003b3;TuSC depends on trace levels of other  &#x003b3;TuRC components that contaminate our &#x003b3;TuSC preps.  Expression and purification of the &#x003b3;TuSC will be necessary to further characterize &#x003b3;TuSC activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide Binding Properties of &#x003b3;-tubulin</title><p>Cross-linking experiments showed that &#x003b3;-tubulin in both  &#x003b3;TuSC and &#x003b3;TuRC can bind guanine nucleotide. To investigate how &#x003b3;-tubulin compares to other members of the tubulin family in its nucleotide binding properties, we compared the nucleotide bound to &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC to that  bound to &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-tubulin dimer after desalting from buffers  containing GDP or GTP. We found, like &#x003b2;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Weisenberg et al., 1976</xref>), &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC binds guanine nucleotide exchangeably. However, in contrast to &#x003b3;-tubulin,  which has about a threefold higher affinity for GTP than  GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Zeeberg and Caplow, 1979</xref>), &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC  strongly prefers binding GDP to GTP. Our results suggest  that the affinity of &#x003b3;-tubulin for GTP is much lower than  that of &#x003b2;-tubulin, based on nucleotide recovery after desalting under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Zeeberg and Caplow,  1979</xref>). Determination of the absolute affinities of &#x003b3;-tubulin  for GDP and GTP will be important to know whether the  affinities of &#x003b3;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin for GDP are similar. If they  are, this will suggest that the strong preference of &#x003b3;-tubulin for GDP is primarily because of a reduction in its affinity for GTP relative to &#x003b2;-tubulin. These experiments will  require a reliable supply of &#x003b3;TuSC, currently limited by  antibody availability for immunoisolation and by lack of  an expressed source. A structural comparison of the nucleotide binding pocket of &#x003b3;-tubulin to those of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin should also be revealing. Development of procedures  to prepare more concentrated and highly purified &#x003b3;TuRC  should allow a comparison of nucleotide binding by  &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuRC to that in the &#x003b3;TuSC. If the nucleotide binding properties of &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuRC are similar  to those of &#x003b3;-tubulin in &#x003b3;TuSC, it will suggest that GTP hydrolysis by &#x003b3;-tubulin may not be important for its function  in vivo.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x003b3;-tubulin complexes nucleate MTs  in vitro.
