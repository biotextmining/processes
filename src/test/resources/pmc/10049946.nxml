This process is triggered by surface receptors specific for inflammatory cytokines or for  conserved patterns characteristic of infectious agents. Here we show that human DCs are activated by influenza virus infection and by double-stranded (ds)RNA. This activation results not  only in increased antigen presentation and T cell stimulatory capacity, but also in resistance to  the cytopathic effect of the virus, mediated by the production of type I interferon, and upregulation of MxA. Because dsRNA stimulates both maturation and resistance, DCs can serve as altruistic antigen-presenting cells capable of sustaining viral antigen production while acquiring  the capacity to trigger naive T cells and drive polarized T helper cell type 1 responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritic cell maturation and activation</kwd><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>double-stranded RNA</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>MxA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Dendritic cells (DCs)<sup>1</sup> serve as the sentinels of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In their so-called immature state,  DCs reside in peripheral tissues, where they survey for incoming pathogens. Encounter with pathogens leads to DC  activation and migration to secondary lymphoid organs  where they trigger a specific T cell response. The capacity  of DCs to recognize invading microbes and become activated therefore represents the first critical event in the initiation of the immune response. Because of the wide variety  of pathogens, DCs should be equipped with receptors capable of recognizing all possible offending agents and should  be able to react in such a way that they maximize the efficiency of antigen presentation.</p><p>Immature DCs, similar to those found in peripheral tissues, can be generated by culturing human monocytes with  GM-CSF and IL-4 and have been used to identify the activation signals that induce DC maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These  cells, which have a high level of endocytic activity but low  T cell stimulatory capacity, are activated to mature into  immunostimulatory DCs by the inflammatory cytokines  TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1, by LPS and by CD40 ligand (CD40L).  The maturation process results in upregulation of adhesion  and costimulatory molecules and downregulation of the endocytic activity and provides an optimal window for loading exogenous antigens on MHC class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Influenza virus infection has been extensively used as a  model to study MHC class I&#x02013;restricted antigen presentation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although the mechanisms and rules that direct loading  of viral peptides on MHC class I molecules have been extensively clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), it is less well understood how  APCs can handle a cytopathic virus. DCs have been shown  to be much more efficient than macrophages in generating  CTL responses after infection with influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>)  and to be able to present on class I molecules viral antigens  taken up from infected apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In addition, it  has been suggested that infection of DCs with influenza virus can overcome the requirements for T cell help in the  stimulation of a CTL response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), although the mechanism  has not been clarified. A relevant question to ask is how immature DCs in peripheral sites can deal with infection by a  cytopathic virus. If DCs have to sustain viral antigen presentation, they must be able to promptly recognize viral infection and compromise between production of viral antigens  and resistance to the cytopathic effect of the virus.</p><p>We report here that human immature DCs are activated  by influenza virus and by double-stranded (ds)RNA. In  DCs, in contrast to other cells, this stimulus leads to increased protein synthesis and upregulation of MHC, adhesion, and costimulatory molecules. It also results in a rapid  production of type I IFN leading to expression of MxA, a  protein that protects the DCs from the lethal effect of the  virus. By linking viral recognition to activation and resistance, DCs serve as altruistic APCs capable of sustaining  production of viral antigens while acquiring the capacity to  trigger a polarized Th1 response.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation and Stimulation of DCs.</title><p>To generate immature DCs,  peripheral blood monocytes purified by centrifugal elutriation  were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone), 50 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 1,000 U/ml IL-4 for 6&#x02013;7 d, as  previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).

These cells are competent in antigen capture  and mature when stimulated by LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, or CD40L,  losing their antigen-capturing capacity and acquiring T cell  stimulatory capacity. Immature and mature DCs, obtained  after LPS or TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation, were incubated with different doses of influenza virus strain PR8, and the proportion of infected cells was measured after 14 h by staining  with a specific mAb. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, there was a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells expressing viral proteins as well as in the level of viral proteins expressed  by individual cells. Immature and TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;matured DCs  were highly susceptible to influenza virus infection: at high  multiplicity of infection (MOI), all cells expressed high levels of viral protein, whereas at low multiplicity viral proteins were expressed in a bimodal distribution. In contrast,  LPS-matured DCs were more, and in some experiments  completely, resistant to infection; at high MOI they  showed a bimodal protein expression, whereas at low multiplicity only a small proportion of cells was infected, expressing low levels of viral proteins. Finally, DCs pretreated  for 40 h with IFN-&#x003b1; were almost completely resistant to  infection. The different susceptibility of DCs to influenza  infection could not be explained by their different levels of  endocytic activity. TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;matured DCs, which had completely lost endocytic activity, were equally, if not more,  susceptible to infection than immature DCs. Conversely,  IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated DCs, which were as endocytic as immature  DCs (data not shown), were completely resistant. </p><p>In search for a mechanism that might modulate the susceptibility of DCs to influenza virus infection, we investigated the expression of MxA, a protein induced by type I  IFN, that is known to mediate resistance to several viruses  including influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). MxA was initially identified  by two-dimensional gel analysis as a protein abundantly  represented in LPS-matured but not immature DCs (Sakakibara, Y., unpublished data).</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the level of MxA expression in relation to  the level of production of viral HA (A&#x02013;G) and to the viability of the infected cells (H&#x02013;P). Immature DCs did not  express MxA, but became MxA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> after infection with PR8,  explaining their capacity to resist the cytopathic effect of  the virus. At low MOI (1:1), immature DCs could be efficiently infected (61%) with no increase in cell death over  the background, whereas at higher MOI they were infected more efficiently and produced higher protein levels,  but showed progressively lower viability. In contrast, LPS-matured DCs, which already expressed MxA, required  &#x0223c;10-fold higher doses of virus to produce comparable  amounts of proteins, but were far more resistant to the cytopathic effect even at an MOI of 100:1. Taken together,  these results suggest that susceptibility to influenza virus infection is modulated in DCs by the expression of MxA,  which is induced by LPS stimulation as well as by infection  with influenza virus. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>MxA Is Induced by Autocrine Production of Type I IFN.</title><p>The time course of MxA protein expression was analyzed  in DCs challenged with different stimuli, either by immunofluorescence on fixed and permeabilized cells or by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, A and B). MxA was induced with  comparable fast kinetics by IFN-&#x003b1;, LPS, and PR8 infection, as well as by poly I:C, a synthetic source of dsRNA.  In contrast, TNF-&#x003b1; failed to induce MxA expression, and  CD40L induced it only to a low extent and with a slower  kinetics. </p><p>The capacity of different stimuli to induce MxA correlated with their capacity to induce production of type I  IFN by DCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C). Both poly I:C and LPS led to a  rapid production of type I IFN that reached a plateau at 4 h,  whereas PR8 infection induced an equally rapid, but more  sustained and consistently higher production. In contrast,  TNF-&#x003b1; and CD40L stimulation did not induce production  of detectable levels of IFN.</p><p>These results demonstrate that DCs can produce type I  IFN in response to specific stimuli, which in turn leads to  upregulation of MxA gene expression via an autocrine  loop. To address this possibility, we evaluated the capacity  of neutralizing antibodies to type I IFNs to inhibit MxA  expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D). The antisera we used completely abrogated MxA upregulation at 5 h induced by recombinant  IFN-&#x003b1;, PR8 infection, and CD40L. However, they also  inhibited significantly, although not completely (at least  50%), MxA induction after LPS or poly I:C stimulation.  Although these results do not rule out the possibility of an  IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;independent MxA upregulation, they suggest that  autocrine production of type I IFN by DCs represents a  major mechanism to ensure the rapid build-up of a resistance state to the infecting virus.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>dsRNA and PR8 Upregulate Protein Synthesis in Immature  and IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated DCs.</title><p>dsRNA has been shown to trigger PKR, an IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced kinase that inactivates eIF2,  thereby reducing protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This mechanism  may be important to ensure reduction of viral replication  and elimination of infected cells. However, PKR has also  been shown to activate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and transcription.  PKR was expressed constitutively in DCs and its level was  not further increased upon IFN-&#x003b1; treatment (data not  shown). We thus compared the effect of poly I:C and PR8  on protein synthesis in DCs and Hela cells before and after  treatment with IFN-&#x003b1; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As expected, PR8 infection  and poly I:C induced a marked decrease in the rate of total  and MHC class I protein synthesis in IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;pretreated,  but not in untreated, Hela cells. In contrast, in DCs the  same treatments resulted in a strong boost of total, and particularly MHC class I, protein synthesis, irrespective of  whether or not the cells had been pretreated with IFN-&#x003b1;.  These results demonstrate that, as compared with other cell  types, DCs have a unique capacity to respond to dsRNA, a  property that may be important to allow efficient presentation of viral antigens. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Influenza Virus Infection Promotes and Sustains Generation of  Peptide&#x02013;MHC Class I Complexes.</title><p>We next investigated  whether stimulation of DCs by infectious virus might optimize loading of class I molecules with antigenic peptides.  In PR8-infected DCs there was a strong upregulation of  HLA class I synthesis (5&#x02013;10-fold in four experiments) (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). Furthermore, the class I molecules synthesized during  the initial stages of infection displayed a two- to threefold  longer half-life than those synthesized in immature or in  LPS-treated DCs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). This increased stability may be  related to the abundant supply of high affinity peptides derived from degradation of viral proteins, since it was not  noticed in DCs stimulated with LPS. </p><p>PR8-infected immature DCs rapidly acquired a high capacity to trigger an HLA-A2&#x02013;restricted T cell clone specific  for the influenza matrix peptide M58-66. Furthermore,  the stimulatory capacity increased with time after infection  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C). In contrast, although immediately stimulatory,  immature DCs pulsed with a high dose of M58-66 peptide  lost the capacity to stimulate specific T cells by 20 h of culture, a finding consistent with the short half-life of MHC  class I&#x02013;peptide complexes. In addition, IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;pretreated  DCs, which were highly resistant to viral infection, did not  stimulate the virus-specific T cell clone even at late time  points.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that in PR8- infected DCs the increased synthesis and loading of MHC  class I molecules results in a rapid and continuous production of large numbers of complexes containing viral peptides. These events allow presentation to T cells to be sustained over a long period of time.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Influenza Virus Infection and dsRNA Trigger DC Maturation  and Prime for a Th1 Response.</title><p>We compared dsRNA and  influenza virus infection to known stimuli for their capacity  to induce DC maturation. As a readout we analyzed the  expression of costimulatory molecules and the production  of Th1 polarizing cytokines (i.e., IL-12 [26]), and evaluated  the capacity of DCs to stimulate and polarize allogeneic naive T cells. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>, poly I:C and PR8 induced a marked upregulation of MHC class I and class II,  CD80, CD86, CD83, and CD38, and downregulation of  CD115, a phenotype characteristic of mature DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).  In addition, poly I:C and PR8 induced the production of  low but significant levels of IL-12 p75 (1&#x02013;2 ng/ml), although the amount detected was always lower (at least 10&#x02013; 50-fold) than that induced via CD40L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Although  TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation never led to production of bioactive  IL-12, low levels of IL-12 p75 (0.1&#x02013;0.2 ng/ml) were detectable after LPS stimulation. On the other hand, IFN-&#x003b1;  tested over a broad range of concentrations (10&#x02013;500 U/ml)  did not induce DC maturation but only upregulation of  HLA class I and a modest shift in the expression of CD38  and CD86 with no significant increase in CD83, HLA class  II, or other costimulatory and adhesion molecules. </p><p>Consistent with the effect on DC maturation and cytokine  production, poly I:C and PR8 increased &#x0223c;30-fold the capacity of DCs to stimulate a proliferative response by allogeneic  CD45RA<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, whereas IFN-&#x003b1; treatment did not  show a significant effect. Poly I:C-matured DCs were as efficient as DCs induced to mature by TNF-&#x003b1; or LPS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).  Although the ability to trigger T cell proliferation was comparable, the capacity to polarize T cells was remarkably different, depending on the nature of the maturative stimulus  applied. Alloreactive T cells expanded by TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;matured  DCs were poorly polarized (only 32% of cells producing either IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-4) and consisted of both Th1 and Th2 (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). In contrast, T cells expanded by poly I:C-matured DCs  were highly polarized (70&#x02013;90%, in different experiments)  with most of the cells producing high amounts of IFN-&#x003b3;,  consistent with a dominant Th1 phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B). Addition of neutralizing antibodies to IL-12 prevented Th1 polarization, skewing the cultures towards a Th2 phenotype (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> C). In some experiments, the inhibition of Th1 development required the simultaneous neutralization of type I IFN  and IL-12 (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that dsRNA and influenza virus infection can induce  DC maturation, and confer the capacity to prime a Th1 response through the production of IL-12 and type I IFN.  </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Protection and Maturation of DCs Induced by the Viral Pattern dsRNA.</title><p>We have shown that dsRNA induces two  functionally distinct responses in DC: (i) protection from  the viral cytopathic effect, and (ii) maturation, leading to  increased capacity to prime and polarize T cells. In the  course of viral infection, the simultaneous induction of  protection and maturation optimizes loading of viral antigens on MHC class I molecules.</p><p>dsRNA is a classical inducer of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>),  which plays a critical role in antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).  DCs represent a strategic source of type I IFN and we have  shown that it is produced not only in response to dsRNA  or virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), but also in response to LPS stimulation. However, IFN is not produced in response to other  stimuli such as TNF-&#x003b1;, and only in minute amounts in response to CD40L. Type I IFN produced by DCs results in  rapid induction of MxA, a cytoplasmic protein that has  been shown to protect cells from the cytopathic effect of  some viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies to type I  IFN completely inhibited MxA induction by recombinant  exogenous IFN-&#x003b1;, influenza virus infection, and CD40L,  but only partially inhibited MxA upregulation by poly I:C  or LPS, suggesting a possible direct activation of MxA expression independent from type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>dsRNA and viral infection also induced a rapid maturation of DCs with upregulation of MHC, adhesion, and costimulatory molecules. These phenotypic changes were to a  large extent comparable to those induced by other maturation stimuli such as LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, or CD40L, although a  different pattern in cytokine production was observed. These  results may well account for the increased capacity of influenza virus&#x02013;infected DCs to stimulate CTL responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).  Although a minor shift in CD38 and CD86 was reproducibly observed, IFN-&#x003b1; per se was unable to support a complete DC maturation. The maturation effect of type I IFN  reported in other studies was observed in a different culture  system and was dependent on the simultaneous presence of  TNF-&#x003b1;, which by itself is a DC maturation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>The signal transduction pathway triggered by dsRNA  has been studied in detail. It has been shown that dsRNA  activates PKR, a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates eIF2, thereby shutting off protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). PKR can also activate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and consequently may induce transcription of genes involved in DC  maturation. The fact that PKR-deficient mice can still respond to dsRNA suggests that there may be additional  pathways of signal transduction that may be operative in  DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The relative role and function of the pathways  activated by dsRNA may vary in different cells. Our experiments show that the response to dsRNA in DCs and Hela  cells is considerably different. In Hela cells dsRNA induces  a downregulation of protein synthesis, whereas in immature DCs dsRNA actually upregulates total protein synthesis, while fully inducing the maturation process.</p><p>It has been suggested that recognition of conserved molecular patterns characteristic of pathogens is a property of  the innate immune system, which is instrumental to initiating and regulating the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our  results clearly indicates that dsRNA behaves as one of such  molecular patterns. dsRNA can directly signal to the APCs  the presence of an infectious agents and, by activating the  DCs, can lead to activation of lymphocytes bearing clonally  specific antigen receptors, thus triggering an adaptive immune response. The relevance of this recognition system is  also underlined by the fact that many viruses specifically  target the dsRNA-binding protein PKR to escape immune  recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Sustained Synthesis of Viral Antigens and Class I Molecules  Maximizes Antigen Presentation.</title><p>We have shown that efficient presentation influenza virus is the result of a delicate  compromise. On one hand, immature DCs are highly susceptible to infection and thus produce large amounts of viral proteins. On the other hand, they can rapidly build up  resistance to the virus, thus limiting its cytopathic effect.  The importance of synchronizing these two functions is illustrated by the fact that IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;pretreated DCs, which are  resistant to influenza infection, are extremely inefficient at  presenting viral antigens.</p><p>The dramatic upregulation of class I synthesis (up to 10-fold) induced by viral infection is an important mechanism  that ensures effective presentation of viral antigens. MHC  class I synthesis is sustained after induction of maturation,  allowing continuous accumulation of peptide&#x02013;MHC complexes and thus compensating for the relatively short half-life of class I molecules (10&#x02013;20 h). The importance of the  sustained antigen loading is exemplified by the fact that although the capacity to stimulate class I&#x02013;restricted, virus-specific T cells is rapidly lost in peptide-pulsed DCs, it actually increases with time in virus-infected DCs. This fact  should be taken into account when considering the use of  DCs as vaccines to induce class I&#x02013;restricted responses.</p><p>We have previously shown that in maturing DCs the  synthesis of class II molecules is transiently upregulated and  subsequently stopped, while stable peptide class II complexes are retained with extremely long half-lives (&#x0003e;100 h)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In contrast, in DCs MHC class I molecules have a short  half-life that is not significantly affected by the maturation  process. The different regulation of class I and class II biosynthesis and stability in DCs makes good sense. Class II  molecules present antigens that are transiently encountered  in the surrounding environment, so it is important for a  DC to be able to load antigenic peptides over a short period of time and retain the antigen as a stable complex. Instead, the short half-life of class I molecules is instrumental  to allow a continuous monitoring of early and late viral antigens, as long as the cell remains infected.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Flexibility in Cytokine Production Determines the T Cell Polarizing Capacity of DCs.</title><p>Although DCs induced to mature by different stimuli share several common features,  such as the increase in MHC, costimulatory molecules, and  T cell stimulatory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), consistent differences are  observed in the pattern of cytokines produced in response  to the different stimuli. These in turn determine both the  extent and the type of T cell polarization, suggesting that  mature DCs can exist in different functional states. TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;matured DCs, which produce neither IL-12 nor type I  IFN, were highly stimulatory, but induced only a low percentage of fully polarized cells. In contrast, dsRNA- or  LPS-matured DCs, which produced both type I IFN and  IL-12 (although in different proportions) elicited strong  Th1 polarization, with 70&#x02013;90% of T cells producing high  levels of IFN-&#x003b3;. The Th1 polarizing effect was inhibited in  most cases by neutralization of IL-12, although in some  cases neutralization of type I IFN was also required, as previously reported for monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). These results indicate  a flexibility of DCs in the use of Th1 polarizing cytokines  and suggest that a multiplicity of responses can be generated by distinct environmental signals. In addition, it is possible that the relative production of IL-12 and type I IFN  may play a more subtle role in modulating T cell polarization. Although both IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and type I IFN in humans  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) are known to drive Th1 polarization, it is possible that  they may play distinct roles by differentially regulating IL-4  and IL-13 production by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>Our results also imply that the nature of the signal inducing DC maturation may determine the capacity of the DCs  to generate polarized immune responses. On one hand,  stimuli from viral or bacterial patterns (dsRNA or LPS) or  T cell help, through CD40&#x02013;CD40L interaction, generate  DCs capable of priming strong Th1 responses. On the  other hand, an endogenous inflammatory stimulus, such as  TNF-&#x003b1;, generates DCs capable of inducing a more balanced response, comprising both Th1 and Th2 cells. The  fact that the same DCs can mature to different functional  states capable of stimulating polarized Th1 or Th2 responses makes good sense, since it allows the APCs to initiate a response that is appropriate for the signal received and  has practical implications for the therapeutic use of DCs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Susceptibility to influenza virus infection of DC populations.
