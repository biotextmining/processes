Isolated salamander rod photoreceptors  were exposed to bright light that bleached a significant fraction of their pigment, were allowed to recover to a  steady state, and then were exposed to &#x003b2;-ionone. Our experiments show that in bleach-adapted rods &#x003b2;-ionone  causes a decrease in light sensitivity and dark current and an acceleration of the dim flash photoresponse and the  rate constants of guanylyl cyclase and cGMP phosphodiesterase. Together, these observations indicate that in  bleach-adapted rods &#x003b2;-ionone activates phototransduction in the dark. Control experiments showed no effect of  &#x003b2;-ionone in either fully dark-adapted or background light-adapted cells, indicating direct interaction of &#x003b2;-ionone  with the free opsin produced by bleaching. We speculate that &#x003b2;-ionone binds specifically in the chromophore  pocket of opsin to produce a complex that is more catalytically potent than free opsin alone. We hypothesize that  a similar reaction may occur in the intact retina during pigment regeneration. We propose a model of rod pigment regeneration in which binding of 11-cis retinal to opsin leads to activation of the complex accompanied by a  decrease in light sensitivity. The subsequent covalent attachment of retinal to opsin completely inactivates opsin  and leads to the recovery of sensitivity. Our findings resolve the conflict between biochemical and physiological  data concerning the effect of the occupancy of the chromophore binding site on the catalytic potency of opsin.  We show that binding of &#x003b2;-ionone to rod opsin produces effects opposite to its previously described effects on  cone opsin. We propose that this distinction is due to a fundamental difference in the interaction of rod and cone  opsins with retinal, which may have implications for the different physiology of the two types of photoreceptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pigment regeneration</kwd><kwd>dark adaptation</kwd><kwd>&#x003b2;-ionone</kwd><kwd>visual pigments</kwd><kwd>bleaching adaptation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Introduction"><title>introduction</title><p>The visual cycle is the series of reactions occurring in  the eye through which visual pigment proceeds from  photoactivation to regeneration. Absorption of a photon by the pigment of a photoreceptor triggers within  milliseconds a series of reactions leading to a cell response. This sequence of reactions, collectively termed  the phototransduction cascade, has been extensively  studied and is now well characterized (for reviews, see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lagnado and Baylor, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Stryer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Pugh and  Lamb, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Yau, 1994</xref>). According to this scheme,  photoisomerization of the chromophore from the 11-cis to the all-trans conformation (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, A and B)  ultimately results in the closure of cation channels and  the hyperpolarization of the cell. Another consequence  of the photon absorption is the eventual dissociation of  the chromophore from the protein moiety of the visual  pigment to form all-trans retinol and free opsin. The visual pigment is then regenerated through a series of reactions requiring less than a minute in cones and tens  of minutes in rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wald et al., 1955</xref>). In the vertebrate  retina, this is a complex process that involves both photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium (for reviews,  see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rando, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Crouch et al., 1996</xref>). Reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol must occur in the  bleached outer segment of photoreceptors before the  opsin binding site becomes accessible for regeneration.  All-trans retinol is then removed from the outer segment and translocated to the pigment epithelium.  There it is converted back to 11-cis retinal, and then returned to the receptor outer segment where it combines with opsin to form visual pigment. </p><p>Aside from the ultimate recovery of visual sensitivity  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Pepperberg et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jones et al., 1989</xref>; Cornwall et  al.<italic>,</italic> 1990), very little is known about the physiological  consequences of the reactions involved in the reconstitution of the visual pigment within photoreceptors. An  important initial step in the recovery process is likely to  be the binding of 11-cis retinal, supplied from the pigment epithelium, into the chromophore pocket of opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Matsumoto and Yoshizawa, 1975</xref>). The effects on  phototransduction and regeneration of a whole host of  retinal analogues have been studied with biochemical  as well as with physiological methods (for reviews, see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Corson and Crouch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Nakanishi and Crouch,  1996</xref>). Treating bleached pigment from rods with derivatives of retinal having shortened polyene chains  produces a catalytically active complex that promotes  phosphorylation of opsin by rhodopsin kinase (Buczylko et al.<italic>,</italic> 1996). Competition studies with 11-cis retinal suggest that these compounds exert their effect by  binding in the chromophore pocket of opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Matsumoto and Yoshizawa, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Crouch et al., 1982</xref>). These  retinoids, including &#x003b2;-ionone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> C), all-trans C17  aldehyde, and 9-cis C17 aldehyde do not form a covalent link with opsin via a Schiff base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Towner et al.,  1981</xref>) because the shorter length of their side chain apparently does not allow them to span from the ring-binding site to the corresponding lysine of opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Daemen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Crouch et al., 1982</xref>). The fact that these  compounds do not form a covalent bond with the protein suggests that occupancy of the chromophore binding site of rod opsin alone is sufficient for catalytic activation of the complex. Thus, these biochemical experiments indicate that, in rods, retinoids with shortened  polyene chains act as agonists, activating the photoreceptor. On the other hand, physiological studies on intact isolated cone photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Jin et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cornwall et al., 1995</xref>) show that in these cells short-chain retinal analogues produce an opposite effect:  treatment of bleached cones with &#x003b2;-ionone or with 9-cis  C17 aldehyde results in downregulation of transduction, characterized by slowed flash responses, increased  sensitivity, and increased dark current. Thus, in cones,  short-chain retinal analogues act as reverse agonists, inactivating the photoreceptor. These latter studies were  interpreted as demonstrating that the noncovalent  binding of retinal in the chromophore pocket of cone  opsin might be an important initial step in dark adaptation.</p><p>The present study was undertaken to resolve the contradictory findings regarding the role retinoids play in  regulating the activity of rod and cone photoreceptors.  The experiments described here also address the question of whether the occupancy of the chromophore  pocket of rod opsin by a retinoid produces physiological consequences that are separate from those due to  the consequent formation of the Schiff base linkage.  The retinal analogue chosen to address these questions  was &#x003b2;-ionone because of its capability of binding in the  chromophore pocket of opsin without forming a covalent bond. Furthermore, as we demonstrate here, its  binding is rapidly and totally reversible. The use of &#x003b2;-ionone enabled us to study specifically the physiological  effect of the noncovalent binding of retinal in the  chromophore pocket of opsin without the interfering  effects of the covalent bond between retinal and opsin.  In addition, treating bleach-adapted rods with &#x003b2;-ionone allowed us to compare directly the effect of its  binding in the chromophore pocket of rod opsin with  its previously described effect in cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Jin et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cornwall et al., 1995</xref>). We present evidence that, in  bleach-adapted rods, occupancy of the chromophore  binding site of opsin by &#x003b2;-ionone causes activation of  the transduction cascade and desensitization of the  cell. This observation is opposite to the expected downregulation of transduction during dark adaptation,  when 11-cis retinal occupies the chromophore pocket.  It is also opposite to the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone observed  in bleach-adapted cone photoreceptors. This newly discovered distinction between rods and cones reconciles  the conflict between biochemical and physiological results, and implies a fundamental difference in the interaction of rod and cone opsins with retinal.</p></sec><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>materials and methods</title><p>Single rod photoreceptors from the retina of the larval tiger salamander <italic>(Ambystoma tigrinum</italic>) were isolated in physiological solution as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cornwall et al., 1990</xref>). In brief, animals were dark-adapted overnight. They were decapitated and  pithed in dim red light, following which the eyes were removed,  hemisected, and placed in &#x0223c;1.5 ml saline solution. The retina  was torn free of the pigment epithelium and chopped into small  pieces with a razor blade. A fraction of the resulting suspension  was transferred to a recording chamber located on the stage of  an inverted microscope (Invertascope D; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="zeiss">Carl Zeiss, Inc.</named-content>). The  remaining portion of the suspension was stored at 4&#x000b0;C in the  dark and remained viable for several hours. The preparation was  viewed via an infrared television camera (WV 5410; Panasonic)  fitted to the inverted microscope and connected to a video monitor. Membrane currents were recorded from solitary rods with a  suction microelectrode using methods similar to those reported  previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Baylor et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cornwall et al., 1990</xref>). The inner  segment of the rod was drawn into the pipette so that the outer  segment could be rapidly superfused with test solutions. The tip  of the electrode was heat-polished to a diameter of &#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;m. The  current recorded from the cell was converted to voltage and amplified using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7; List Electronic),  and low-pass filtered with an active eight-pole filter at 20 Hz cutoff frequency (902LPF; Frequency Devices Inc.). The data were  digitized at 250 Hz, stored on a computer, and subsequently analyzed using the pCLAMP 6 data acquisition and analysis software  (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="axon">Axon Instruments</named-content>) and the Origin 4 graphics and data analysis  software (Microcal Software, Inc.).</p><sec><title>Light Stimulation</title><p>A dual-beam optical stimulator provided test flashes as well as  bleaching and background lights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cornwall et al., 1990</xref>). The  light source was calibrated at the beginning of each experiment  with a photometer (80&#x000d7;; United Detector Technology). The absolute intensity of the test flash/bleaching beam was 1.36 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>  photons &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (500 nm); the absolute intensity for the background beam was 1.28 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> photons &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (520 nm). Light  intensity for each beam was attenuated with a series of calibrated  neutral density filters. The wavelength was set with narrow band  interference filters (10 nm bandwidth at 1/2 transmission; Corion Optics). A stimulus spot 1 mm in diameter was focused at  the plane of the preparation by a 0.25 NA &#x000d7; 10 achromat objective located above the stage of the inverted microscope. Test  flash duration was 20 ms. The fraction of bleached pigment was  calculated according to the relation: <disp-formula id="E1"><label>1</label><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

The solution in which the guanylyl cyclase activity was measured was made by adding 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)<sup>1</sup> to normal saline solution to a final concentration  of 500 &#x003bc;M (IBMX solution). The solution in which phosphodiesterase activity was measured (Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solution) was made by replacing NaCl in the saline solution with equimolar LiCl. &#x003b2;-Ionone was  purchased from <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma Chemical Co.</named-content> and was repurified by double  distillation. It was dissolved to 20 mM in EtOH and then to its final  concentration with saline solution (final EtOH concentration  &#x0003c;0.1%). &#x003b2;-Ionone concentration was measured with a spectrophotometer (&#x003b5; &#x0003d; 8,700 M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Despite all attempts to minimize  the binding of &#x003b2;-ionone to the plastic tubing by replacing most of  it with glass, the concentration of &#x003b2;-ionone at the outflow of the  microperfusion system in the recording bath was significantly reduced. For this reason, the concentration of &#x003b2;-ionone to which the  cell was exposed was determined from samples collected from the  outflow of the microperfusion tubing after each experiment.</p><p>The outer segment of the cell was exposed to &#x003b2;-ionone and test  solutions using a double-barrel microperfusion system driven by  a stepping motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cornwall et al., 1995</xref>). This system allowed for  quick change of the solution perfusing the outer segment. The  time required for a complete solution change, estimated from  the junction current recorded while the cell was exposed to  bright light, was &#x0223c;25 ms. Test solutions for estimation of rate  constants of guanylyl cyclase and phosphodiesterase (to be referred to as rate of guanylyl cyclase and rate of phosphodiesterase) were delivered through one of the barrels of the microperfusion system using a multiple-way valve. The time for removing the dead volume in the system was &#x0223c;45 s. This allowed  for effective estimation of both cyclase and phosphodiesterase  rates within 1 min. &#x003b2;-Ionone was delivered to the cell through  the other barrel of the microperfusion system. Initially, &#x003b2;-ionone  flow was turned off so that jumps could be performed from saline  solution into test solution (Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and IBMX). Subsequently, &#x003b2;-ionone flow was turned on and its effect on cyclase and phosphodiesterase rates was estimated by jumping the cell from &#x003b2;-ionone  into the test solution. The lack of &#x003b2;-ionone in the test solutions  had only a negligible effect on the measurements of cyclase and  phosphodiesterase rates.</p><p>The flow rates of the &#x003b2;-ionone and test solutions were regulated by injecting phenol red solution into the experimental  chamber before each experiment. The sharp interface between  the bath solution and the solutions flowing through the solution  changer allowed us to observe and adjust the flow of both &#x003b2;-ionone and test solutions. The cells were not exposed to phenol red  because in control experiments we observed that phenol red activates phototransduction in bleach-adapted rods.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>To estimate the rates of cyclase and phosphodiesterase in the  cell, we have used a modification of the method initially described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hodgkin and Nunn (1988)</xref> and subsequently used by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cornwall and Fain (1994)</xref>.

The rate at which the current changes immediately after  the block provides an estimate of the velocity at which cGMP is  being synthesized or hydrolyzed by the unaffected enzyme. Using  this scheme, the rate of cyclase can be estimated by treating the  cell with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX. Sudden exposure of the cell to saline solution containing 500 &#x003bc;M IBMX substantially inhibits phosphodiesterase and the continued production of cGMP by cyclase results in current increase. The rate of  increase of the current provides an estimate of the rate of cGMP  synthesis by cyclase. Alternatively, saline solution in which Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is  substituted for Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> can be used to estimate the rate of phosphodiesterase. Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> permeates the light-sensitive channels but the presence of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> inside the cell blocks the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> exchange  mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Yau and Nakatani, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hodgkin et al., 1985</xref>). As a  result, [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases rapidly and inhibits cyclase. The rate of  the resulting decrease in current provides an estimate of the rate  of hydrolysis of cGMP by phosphodiesterase.</p><p>Derivation of a useful expression of the current as a function  of the enzymatic rates of cyclase or phosphodiesterase with the  help of test solutions requires several important assumptions that  were implicitly made in the original work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hodgkin and Nunn  (1988)</xref>. However, new information makes necessary the explicit  reexamination of these assumptions. The simpler case of the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  jump requires the assumption that the cGMP channel characteristics (<italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and <italic>N</italic>), as well as <italic>i</italic><sub>m</sub>, do not change during or immediately after the solution change. Recent evidence has revealed  that of these three parameters only <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> is not constant but  rather varies as a function of the concentration of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hsu  and Molday, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Gordon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Nakatani et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bauer, 1996</xref>). As pointed out above, stepping into Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> results in  an increase of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. A decrease in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> within the physiological range can cause a significant decrease of <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub>. However,  an increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> beyond the physiological range, as in the  case of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> step, causes very little or no change of <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub>. Thus, the  proposition that <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, <italic>N</italic>, and <italic>i</italic><sub>m</sub> do not change during and immediately after the step in Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solution is valid. A second assumption  is that the current <italic>i</italic>, recorded with the suction electrode, is much  smaller than <italic>i</italic><sub>m</sub> (respective typical values, 40 pA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Baylor et al.,  1984</xref>] and &#x0003e;1,000 pA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cameron and Pugh, 1990</xref>]). Thus, the ratio <italic>i</italic>/(<italic>i</italic><sub>m</sub> &#x02212; <italic>i</italic>) in Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E4">4</xref> can be replaced by the more simple <italic>i</italic>/<italic>i</italic><sub>m</sub>.

Another potential complication is that <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> is likely to be different in rods that  are dark-adapted, bleached, or chemically treated. As can be  seen from Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E8">8</xref>, in contrast to the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> method, calculation of the  relative rate of cyclase requires direct comparison of <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> in the  dark-adapted and in the bleached or otherwise manipulated cell.  As pointed out above, <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of the cGMP-gated channel is not constant, but rather varies as a function of the concentration of calcium. The decrease in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> produced by the bleach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Sampath  et al., 1998</xref>) and probably by &#x003b2;-ionone can cause a significant decrease of <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Nakatani et al., 1995</xref>). To improve the accuracy of  the calculation of the rate of cyclase, we have incorporated an estimate of the change of <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> caused by the bleaching of pigment  in our analysis. This was done in the following way. The time derivative of the current <italic>di/dt</italic> was calculated using the Savitzki-Golay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Press et al., 1992</xref>). Since the data were acquired  at 250 Hz (4 ms/point) and filtered at 20 Hz (50 ms/point), the  linear regression was performed over 13 points (13 &#x000d7; 4 ms &#x0003d; 52  ms, corresponding to 19 Hz). The change in <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> after the bleach  was calculated from the corresponding drop in the dark current  using the relation between current and [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in Nakatani et al.  (1995, see Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Using Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E6">6</xref>, &#x003b1;&#x02032; was obtained in each experimental condition, and then the ratio &#x003b1;/&#x003b1;<sub>D </sub>(equal to &#x003b1;&#x02032;/&#x003b1;&#x02032;<sub>D</sub>) was  calculated.  </p><p>The measurements of the rates of cyclase and phosphodiesterase in this study were done pairwise in the same cell, under  the same conditions, and within 1 min of each other. To minimize possible side effects, the order of measurements was varied  from cell to cell. Thus, direct comparison between the two enzymatic rates should be much more accurate than when two different cells from two different animals are considered. Since all of  the measurements of the velocities of cyclase and phosphodiesterase were done in steady state, it would be expected that the  two relative velocities (see Eqs. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E8">8</xref>) will be equal. Accounting for the change in <italic>K</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and modifying the analysis of IBMX  jumps originally devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hodgkin and Nunn (1988)</xref> and later  used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cornwall and Fain (1994)</xref> compensated for the mismatch between the rates of cyclase and phosphodiesterase observed in these studies. In our experience, the two rates were very  similar for activation of the phototransduction cascade by  bleaches of up to 40%. For even higher transduction levels  (higher bleaches), the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> method saturates due to the overlap  of the initial rapid influx of Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ions, caused by the higher permeability of the light-dependent channels to Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> than to Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hodgkin et al., 1985</xref>), and the decrease in cGMP-activated current, caused by the block of cyclase. In addition, after higher  bleaches, the dark current is significantly reduced, which makes  the rate of its decrease in Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solution more difficult to measure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>results</title><sec><title>Photocurrent and Light Sensitivity</title><p>The experiment illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the effect  that &#x003b2;-ionone has on the dark current and sensitivity of  a bleach-adapted rod. The cell was stimulated with a series of test flashes of increasing intensity to monitor  changes in the amplitude of the current and in sensitivity. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A illustrates a series of superimposed flash responses recorded from a dark-adapted rod. After a  brief exposure to bright light that bleached 20% of the  visual pigment, the cell was allowed to recover for 35  min until its dark (light-suppressible) current reached  a new steady state level from which no further recovery  occurred. The bleach caused a steady reduction in the  dark current, as evidenced by the decreased amplitude  of the saturating flash response (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). When the  rod was then exposed to &#x003b2;-ionone, the dark current declined further within several seconds to a new, lower  level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C), which persisted for as long as the cell  remained in &#x003b2;-ionone solution. After returning the rod  to normal saline solution, the dark current recovered  to its bleach-adapted level within 5 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D). The  amplitudes of the flash responses in each condition  were plotted against flash intensity to create the corresponding intensity&#x02013;response curves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E). Bleaching increased the test flash intensity required to elicit a  threshold response (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E, &#x025b4;) compared with the  dark-adapted state (&#x025aa;). Thus, the sensitivity of the cell  after the bleach was lower than that of its dark-adapted  state. Treatment of the bleached cell with &#x003b2;-ionone reduced further its sensitivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E, &#x02022;), at the same  time decreasing the maximal response amplitude. After  returning the rod to normal saline solution, both sensitivity and maximal response amplitude recovered to  their bleach-adapted levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E, &#x025be;). Thus, &#x003b2;-ionone caused a reversible decrease in dark current and  sensitivity in bleach-adapted rods. When cells were exposed to a sufficiently bright light to totally suppress  the dark current and treated with &#x003b2;-ionone, only a  small junction current was observed. Thus, the decreased amplitude of the responses elicited in &#x003b2;-ionone  solution appeared to result from a decrease in the light-sensitive conductance. </p><p>The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on the dark current and the  sensitivity was tested in a total of 36 bleach-adapted  cells. All of them exhibited a decrease in both dark current and sensitivity in the presence of &#x003b2;-ionone. The  magnitude of pigment bleaching ranged from 3 to  80%. &#x003b2;-Ionone concentrations used varied from 1 to  20 &#x003bc;M. For low concentrations of &#x003b2;-ionone (up to 5 &#x003bc;M),  the decrease in the dark current was greater for larger  bleaches until it saturated at &#x0223c;20% pigment bleach.  For higher concentrations of &#x003b2;-ionone, the decrease in  the dark current was also larger for larger bleaches, but  the effect did not saturate in the range of bleaches that  were tested. Owing to their variable nature, it was not  possible to determine the exact relationship between  the decrease in the dark current and the magnitude of  the pigment bleach or the concentration of &#x003b2;-ionone.  For this reason, we chose to restrict our analysis to the  effect of 10 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-ionone in rods in which 20% of the  pigment had been bleached. In a total of 21 cells tested  under these conditions, the mean decrease in the dark  current caused by &#x003b2;-ionone was 51 &#x000b1; 8% (SEM, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d;  21). The corresponding decrease in sensitivity was 0.91 &#x000b1;  0.08 log units (SEM, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10).</p></sec><sec><title>Dim Flash Kinetics</title><p>The response amplitude is a linear function of light intensity at the lower end of the intensity&#x02013;response curve  for both rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Baylor and Hodgkin, 1973</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Kleinschmidt and Dowling, 1975</xref>). This implies that for  dim flashes, the photoresponse is equal to the linear  sum of the responses to single photons. Thus, analysis  of the kinetics of dim flash responses allows for investigation of the kinetics of the phototransduction cascade. Activation of transduction by a bleach or by background light accelerates the dim flash response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cornwall et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matthews et al., 1990</xref>). To  investigate whether the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on the dark  current and photosensitivity is a result of activation of  phototransduction as opposed to a nonspecific effect,  we looked at its impact on the kinetics of dim flash responses. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows normalized dim flash responses  elicited from a cell, first in the dark-adapted state, 40  min after 20% of the pigment had been bleached, and  then during and after exposure to &#x003b2;-ionone. As expected, bleaching accelerated significantly the photoresponse. After bleaching, the time to peak of the dim  flash response was reduced by &#x0003e;25%. Treatment of the  bleached cell with &#x003b2;-ionone resulted in further acceleration of the kinetics of the response. The effect of  &#x003b2;-ionone was completely reversible and several minutes  after returning the cell to normal saline solution, the  response slowed to its pretreatment, bleach-adapted  level. Thus, &#x003b2;-ionone caused a reversible acceleration  of the dim flash response in a bleach-adapted rod. </p></sec><sec><title>Rate of Guanylyl Cyclase</title><p>To investigate the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on phototransduction in detail, we performed a series of experiments designed to measure directly the rates of cyclase and  phosphodiesterase and to evaluate their change when  the cell was exposed to &#x003b2;-ionone (see <sc>materials and  methods</sc>). Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows typical results from one experiment in which cyclase was studied. Using the microperfusion system, the rod was quickly exposed to saline test  solution containing 500 &#x003bc;M IBMX in order to block  phosphodiesterase. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (left) shows current recordings during the solution change. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (right) plots  <italic>d</italic>(<italic>J</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;<sup>1/3</sup>)/<italic>dt</italic> as a function of time, where <italic>J</italic> &#x0003d; <italic>i</italic>/<italic>i</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;<sup>D</sup>. The  time course of the solution change in both cases is  shown on the top of the figure. Since the derivative of  <italic>J</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;<sup>1/3</sup> is proportional to the rate of change in cGMP concentration (see <sc>materials and methods</sc>, Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E2">2</xref>), its  maximum represents a measure of the rate of synthesis  of cGMP by guanylyl cyclase. The rate of cyclase was  first measured in the dark-adapted cell (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). Here,  cyclase had only a low basal activity. After a 20% bleach  followed by a recovery period, the rate of cyclase was  measured once again (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). The rate of current increase upon jumping into IBMX solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B,  left) was higher than in the dark-adapted state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>  A, left). As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cornwall and Fain,  1994</xref>), the rate of cyclase increases as a result of a  bleach, as can be seen here from the greater than  threefold increase in the peak of the derivative (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>  B, right) as compared with that measured before bleaching (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A, right). Exposure of the bleached cell to  &#x003b2;-ionone produced a twofold further acceleration of  cyclase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C). The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone was completely reversed a few minutes after the cell was returned to normal saline solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D). Thus, &#x003b2;-ionone caused a reversible acceleration of guanylyl cyclase  in a bleach-adapted rod.</p><p>The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on the rate of cyclase was studied in a total of 30 bleach-adapted rods. In all of them,  &#x003b2;-ionone caused acceleration of cyclase. The range of  pigment bleaches used was from 3 to 80%, and the  range of &#x003b2;-ionone concentrations was from 3 to 20 &#x003bc;M.  No clear quantitative correlation between the fraction  of pigment bleached, or the concentration of &#x003b2;-ionone, and the corresponding acceleration of cyclase  could be observed. However, in general, for a given  bleached fraction of visual pigment, the relative rate of  cyclase, compared with the bleach-adapted state, was  higher for higher concentrations of &#x003b2;-ionone. On the  other hand, for a given concentration of &#x003b2;-ionone, the  relative acceleration of cyclase was higher for smaller  bleaches. As in the experiments described in the previous section, we studied in detail the effect of 10 &#x003bc;M  &#x003b2;-ionone after a 20% pigment bleach. A total of 18 rods  were studied under these conditions. The rate of cyclase in the presence of &#x003b2;-ionone was 2.5 &#x000b1; 0.3 (SEM, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d;  18) times higher than in the corresponding bleach-adapted state.</p></sec><sec><title>Rate of Phosphodiesterase</title><p>To substantiate further the conclusion that &#x003b2;-ionone  activates phototransduction, the rate of phosphodiesterase was measured within 2 min of the cyclase rate  measurement in these same rods. The minimum time  between the two measurements was limited by the time  required for the new test solution to fill the dead space  in the microperfusion tubing. Since the current was at  steady state while the cell was exposed to &#x003b2;-ionone, the  concentration of cGMP should be constant, and the  rates of its synthesis by cyclase and its hydrolysis by  phosphodiesterase should be equal. The activation of  cyclase as a result of treatment of the bleached cell with  &#x003b2;-ionone then should be accompanied by a corresponding acceleration of phosphodiesterase.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows one example of an experiment in which  the rate of phosphodiesterase was measured. In this  case, cyclase was blocked by suddenly exposing the cell  to a test solution in which Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was substituted for Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  on an equimolar basis. The time course of the jump  into Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> solution is shown at the top of the figure. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  (left) shows the current recordings from the cell; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  (right) shows semi-logarithmic plots of the normalized  current as a function of time. Here, the slope is proportional to the rate of the phosphodiesterase (Eq. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="E5">5</xref>). As  with cyclase, bleaching produced an acceleration of  phosphodiesterase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B), and subsequent treatment with &#x003b2;-ionone resulted in an even higher enzymatic rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C). Again, the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone was  completely reversible upon return of the cell to normal  saline solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> D). Thus, &#x003b2;-ionone caused a reversible acceleration of cGMP phosphodiesterase in a  bleach-adapted rod. </p><p>The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on phosphodiesterase was  measured under the same bleaching conditions and  the same &#x003b2;-ionone concentrations as cyclase (see the  previous section) in a total of 30 cells. In 25 cells, &#x003b2;-ionone caused acceleration of phosphodiesterase and in  the remaining 5 either no effect or a small deceleration  was observed. However, in 4 of these 5 cells the fraction  of the bleached pigment was 40% or higher. We interpret the inconsistency in these cells as being due to the  inability of the Li<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> jump method to resolve the high  rate of phosphodiesterase after large bleaches (see <sc>materials and methods</sc>). This speculation is supported  by the fact that in contrast to phosphodiesterase, cyclase was accelerated in these cells and there was a decrease in both the dark current and the sensitivity as a  result of the treatment with &#x003b2;-ionone. In the remaining  25 cells, the acceleration of phosphodiesterase was  higher after smaller bleaches for each &#x003b2;-ionone concentration. In 17 experiments similar to those presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, we examined the effect of 10 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-ionone after a 20% pigment bleach. In these cells, the rate  of phosphodiesterase in the presence of &#x003b2;-ionone was  1.7 &#x000b1; 0.2 (SEM, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17) times higher than in the corresponding bleach-adapted state.</p></sec><sec><title>Phototransduction in a Dark-adapted Rod in the Presence of &#x003b2;-Ionone</title><p>Experiments were designed to investigate the possible  site of action of &#x003b2;-ionone on phototransduction. Specifically, we were interested in testing the hypothesis that  &#x003b2;-ionone activates transduction by binding directly in  the chromophore pocket of opsin. To test this idea, we  compared the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone in a dark-adapted and  background light-adapted rod with its effect after a  bleach. As a first step, we examined the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone in dark-adapted cells. A total of 16 cells were tested.  In a small fraction of these, treatment with &#x003b2;-ionone resulted in a slight activation of phototransduction. The  decrease in the dark current, the loss of sensitivity, and  the acceleration of cyclase and phosphodiesterase produced by &#x003b2;-ionone in these dark-adapted rods, although significant, was small compared with the effect  of &#x003b2;-ionone seen after 20% or higher pigment bleaches.  The observed acceleration of phototransduction in  some of the control experiments could be due to the  fact that some of the cells were not completely dark  adapted and contained some small fraction of bleached  pigment. In accord with this notion, we observed that  &#x003b2;-ionone activates phototransduction even after bleaches  as low as 3%. Because the cells were exposed to dim red  and infrared light during preparation, it is possible that  in some cases a small but significant fraction of pigment was bleached. This idea is supported by the observation that the sensitivity of the cells slightly increased  during the first 30&#x02013;60 min after the dissection (data not  shown), despite the fact that the animals were dark-adapted overnight. The interaction of the pigment  bleached during the dissection with &#x003b2;-ionone could  produce the observed activation of phototransduction.</p><p>To test this hypothesis directly, two dark-adapted  cells that showed some acceleration of the transduction  cascade during exposure to &#x003b2;-ionone were treated with  11-cis retinal in an effort to regenerate any residual  bleached pigment. In both cells, about 1 h after addition of 11-cis retinal, the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on sensitivity, dim flash kinetics, and cyclase and phosphodiesterase velocities was either significantly reduced or  absent. Thus, complete regeneration of the pigment  abolished the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone. Another argument,  consistent with this notion, is based on the following  observation: a hemisected eyecup was dark adapted for  24 h at 4&#x000b0;C after the dissection. Treatment of five cells  from this preparation with &#x003b2;-ionone produced no effect, presumably because the pigment bleached during  the dissection was regenerated in the intact retina during this additional dark period. Taken together, these  observations indicate that treatment with &#x003b2;-ionone produces a small effect on transduction in freshly dissected  dark-adapted cells and no effect in fully dark-adapted  cells where all of the pigment has been regenerated.</p></sec><sec><title>Rate of Guanylyl Cyclase and Phosphodiesterase in Bleached  vs. Light-adapted Cell</title><p>As a second step in investigating the possible site of action of &#x003b2;-ionone, we compared its effect in a background light-adapted rod with its effect after a bleach.  In both cases, the level of phototransduction activity is  higher than in the dark-adapted state. However, the  background light intensity required to produce activation comparable with that of a significant pigment  bleach is so low that it only photoactivates a negligible  fraction of the pigment. For instance, a steady background producing activation of cyclase (phosphodiesterase) equivalent to a 20% bleach (12.8 photons  &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) would bleach &#x0003c;0.03% of the pigment in 1 h. Thus, even though both bleaching and  background light produce elevation of the rate of phototransduction, the retinal binding pocket on opsin  may be free and available for binding only in the  bleached state.</p><p>In four rods, the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on cyclase in  background light was directly compared with its effect  on cyclase after a bleach. Each cell was first exposed to  a series of backgrounds of increasing intensity. For  each background, the rate of cyclase was measured in  both saline solution and in &#x003b2;-ionone solution. An example at one background is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A (saline  solution) and B (&#x003b2;-ionone). The cell was then bleached  and allowed to recover to a steady state. The rate of cyclase was measured once again in saline solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>  C), and then in &#x003b2;-ionone (D). Comparison between  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A and C, shows that one of the backgrounds  induced exactly the same activation of cyclase as the  subsequent bleaching. &#x003b2;-Ionone failed to produce any  effect on the rate of cyclase in the background light-adapted state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B), but in contrast increased significantly the rate of cyclase after the cell was bleached  (D). This result indicates that the activation of phototransduction is not sufficient to induce acceleration  of cyclase by &#x003b2;-ionone.</p><p>In an experiment similar to the one just described,  the effects of &#x003b2;-ionone on the rate of phosphodiesterase in the light- and bleach-adapted states were  also compared. In the two tested rods, &#x003b2;-ionone only  accelerated phosphodiesterase in the bleach-adapted  state, but did not affect the background light-adapted  state. This result complements the result for cyclase described in the previous paragraph. Taken together,  they indicate that &#x003b2;-ionone activates phototransduction  only in the presence of bleached pigment. This observation supports the hypothesis that &#x003b2;-ionone affects phototransduction by interacting selectively with bleached  pigment.</p></sec><sec><title>Time Course of the Effect of &#x003b2;-Ionone After a Bleach</title><p>The results illustrated in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> are from an experiment designed to determine the time course of onset of transduction activation triggered by &#x003b2;-ionone.  Since for the first few minutes after bleaching the rates  of both cyclase and phosphodiesterase are too high to  be measured reliably with a solution step, we chose the  amplitude of the dark current as an index of the level  of transduction. The cell was exposed to saturating test  flashes to measure the dark current first in saline solution and then 25 s after exposure to &#x003b2;-ionone solution.  The fact that the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone is completely reversible allowed us to do repetitive measurements in  the course of recovery of the cell after the bleach. Current recordings from one such experiment are presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A shows recordings from one rod  in its dark-adapted state and at different times after the  bleach. In the dark-adapted cell, a jump into &#x003b2;-ionone  caused only a small junction current shift, but not a  change in the amplitude of the saturating photoresponse. Thus, as described above, &#x003b2;-ionone did not affect the light-sensitive current in the dark-adapted cell.  After bleaching 20% of the pigment, the current was  initially completely suppressed, and then started to rapidly recover. During this period when the dark current  was increasing quickly, estimation of the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone was rendered unreliable by the fact that measurements of the current in saline solution and in &#x003b2;-ionone  were made 45 s apart. Several minutes after the bleach,  the recovery of the cell slowed down sufficiently to allow reliable comparison of the dark current in saline  solution and in &#x003b2;-ionone solution without any significant drift in the current during the 45 s between test  flashes. Jumping into &#x003b2;-ionone solution produced a  drop in the current whose total amplitude increased  with time after the bleach. The kinetics of the decrease  in the current caused by &#x003b2;-ionone were carefully examined. The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone on the current at different  times after the bleach can be seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B. These recordings are from the same cell as Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, but are superimposed and plotted on a different time scale. For  each of the traces recorded after the bleach, the current decrease caused by &#x003b2;-ionone could be described  by a single exponential decay function. For the cell  shown on Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the time constant of these exponential  functions changed from 12 s, measured 13 min after  the bleach, to 3.7 s 1-h later. The time constant of the  exponential current decay decreased with time after  the bleach in all nine rods tested. On average, the decrease of the current caused by &#x003b2;-ionone shortly after  the bleach was two times slower than the decrease in  the current recorded 1-h later.  </p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> shows the time course of the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone  on the dark current amplitude for the same cell as a  function of time after the bleach. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A presents the  amplitude of the current in saline solution and in &#x003b2;-ionone in the dark-adapted cell and at different time points  after the bleach. As pointed out above, the current immediately after the bleach was completely suppressed.  The amplitude of the current in &#x003b2;-ionone 7 min after  the bleach was slightly higher than the corresponding  amplitude in saline solution measured 45 s earlier. As  discussed above, we interpret this observation not to be  a result of the treatment with &#x003b2;-ionone, but rather to  follow from the fast recovery of the cell during that period. 13 min after the bleach, the amplitude of the current in &#x003b2;-ionone was already clearly smaller than the  corresponding current in saline solution and with time  that difference became more pronounced. To estimate  the rate of the increase of this effect, we calculated the  relative decrease in the current caused by &#x003b2;-ionone as a  function of time after the bleach. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B shows the ratio of the amplitudes of the current in &#x003b2;-ionone and in  saline solution from A, plotted against the time after  the bleach. The decrease of that ratio could be fit by a  single exponential decay function with a time constant  of 13 &#x000b1; 1.1 (SEM) min. The average time constant for  all cells tested in this way was 13 &#x000b1; 2.1 (SEM, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8)  min. This rate of increase of the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone as a  function of time after a bleach is of the same order as  the rate of decay of photoactivated pigment to free opsin and all-trans retinol derived from spectrophotometric experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Baumann, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Brin and Ripps, 1977</xref>)  or with early receptor potential measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cone  and Cobbs, 1969</xref>). The fact that the amplitude of the  effect of &#x003b2;-ionone correlates with the concentration of  free opsin in the cell provides another argument in  support of the notion that &#x003b2;-ionone exerts its effect by  interacting exclusively with free opsin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>discussion</title><sec><title>Effect of &#x003b2;-Ionone on Phototransduction in a Bleach-adapted Rod</title><p>Our experiments show that in bleach-adapted rods &#x003b2;-ionone causes (a) a decrease in the dark current, (b) a decrease in the sensitivity, (c) an acceleration of the dim  flash photoresponse, and (d) an increase in the rates of  guanylyl cyclase and cGMP phosphodiesterase. Together,  these results indicate that in bleach-adapted rods &#x003b2;-ionone acts as an agonist and activates phototransduction  in the dark. &#x003b2;-Ionone produces no effect in fully dark-adapted cells, where the basal level of transduction is  low and the chromophore pockets of the opsin molecules are still occupied by native 11-cis retinal. Furthermore, &#x003b2;-ionone produces no effect in background light-adapted cells, where the level of transduction is high  but still most of the chromophore pockets are occupied by 11-cis retinal. The rate at which the amplitude  of the observed effect increases in time after the bleach  is of the same order as the rate of decay of photoactivated rod pigment to free opsin. Based on these observations, we conclude that the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone is the  result of its direct interaction with the free opsin molecules produced by the bleaching light.</p><p>We suggest that &#x003b2;-ionone exerts its physiological effect by binding directly in the chromophore pocket of  free opsin. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> presents a model of the proposed  mechanism of activation of phototransduction by &#x003b2;-ionone in rods. The chromophore pocket of opsin is shown  schematically and the points of interaction of opsin  with retinal or with &#x003b2;-ionone are indicated by a star.  For each intermediate state, the relative enzymatic activity is indicated by the amplitude of the vertical bar to  the right. In the dark-adapted state, 11-cis retinal is  bound in the chromophore pocket of opsin and is covalently attached to it via a Schiff base linkage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  A). The dark-adapted pigment is not capable of activating phototransduction beyond its basal level, as indicated by the absence of a vertical bar on the right. Absorption of a photon by the pigment molecule results  in the photoisomerization of retinal and the full activation of the complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). Decay of this photoactivated rhodopsin produces all-trans retinol and free opsin. The bleached pigment exhibits low catalytic activity  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C), resulting in a level of transduction in the  bleach-adapted state higher than in the dark-adapted  state. Binding of &#x003b2;-ionone in the free chromophore  pocket of opsin produces a complex with catalytic activity that is higher than that of free opsin alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  D). The upregulation of phototransduction caused by  this increase in the catalytic activity of the bleached pigment can be observed physiologically and is reported  here. As expected for the noncovalent type of interaction between &#x003b2;-ionone and opsin, the binding of &#x003b2;-ionone is reversible and its removal from the pocket results in restoration of the bleach-adapted catalytic activity of free opsin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C). </p></sec><sec><title>Contrast between the Effect of &#x003b2;-Ionone in Rods and Cones</title><p>The effect of &#x003b2;-ionone in bleach-adapted salamander  cones has been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Jin et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cornwall et al., 1995</xref>). In cones, &#x003b2;-ionone partially reverses the effect of bleaching and downregulates phototransduction. In other words, administration of &#x003b2;-ionone to a bleach-adapted cone restores some of the  large loss in sensitivity produced by the bleach and reverses the acceleration of the dim flash response. The  dark current recovers partially. Treatment of bleach-adapted cones with &#x003b2;-ionone also causes a decrease in  the rate of guanylyl cyclase. These results on cones are  in direct contrast with the results reported here for  rods. Thus, the interaction of &#x003b2;-ionone with the chromophore-binding pocket of rod and cone opsins leads  to opposite physiological effects. This observation resolves the current discrepancy between biochemical  and physiological data and suggests that the biochemical observation that opsin is activated by the binding of  retinoid in the chromophore pocket is correct but applies only to rod opsin rather than to both rod and  cone opsin.</p><p>The contrast between the chromophore pockets of  rods and cones is not limited to the interaction with  &#x003b2;-ionone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Jones et al. (1989)</xref> observed a significant decrease in the sensitivity of bleach-adapted rods treated  with 11-cis retinol. In the same study, 11-cis retinol  caused recovery of sensitivity in bleach-adapted cones.  Together, these observations indicate that the contrast  between rods and cones outlined here may be a fundamental feature of the interaction of the two types of opsin with their native chromophore.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature of Bleaching Adaptation</title><p>The state of opsin that is responsible for bleaching adaptation is a matter of controversy. According to one  model, the free opsin produced after bleaching exhibits a low catalytic activity that sustains an elevated level  of transduction in the bleached cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cornwall and  Fain, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cornwall et al., 1995</xref>). An alternative view is  that interaction of all-trans retinal with free opsin is the  factor causing bleaching adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Fukada and  Yoshizawa, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hofmann et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Palczewski et al.,  1994</xref>). A strong argument for a free opsin mechanism  of bleaching adaptation deriving from our findings is  that the occupancy of the chromophore pocket by  &#x003b2;-ionone produces opposite effects in rods and cones.  The noncovalent binding of all-trans retinal in the  pocket would also be expected to produce opposite effects in rods and cones and therefore could not account for the bleaching adaptation in both photoreceptor types. In contrast, the sustained catalytic activity  of free opsin could explain the elevated rate of phototransduction observed in both rods and cones after a  bleach. Thus, the results from our experiments make it  unlikely that bleaching adaptation is the result of the  interaction of all-trans retinal with the chromophore  pocket of free opsin.</p><p>Finally, our observations of the effect of &#x003b2;-ionone in  bleach-adapted rods may have important implications  for the physiology of regeneration of rhodopsin in the  intact retina. By analogy with the results reported here,  binding of the native 11-cis retinal in the chromophore  pocket of rod opsin might be expected to form an active noncovalent complex that results in transient upregulation of phototransduction and transient reduction in the sensitivity of the rod. In contrast, binding of  retinal in the chromophore pocket of cone opsin  might be expected to downregulate transduction, and  thus contribute to the partial recovery of the sensitivity  of the cone even before the formation of the Schiff base  linkage and the regeneration of the pigment. Verification of this model will require further investigation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structures of the  retinoids.
