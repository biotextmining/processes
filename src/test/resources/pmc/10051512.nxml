It was immediately suggested that these events are likely  to reflect the localized release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from a small cluster of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channels or perhaps even from a single SR channel (Cheng  et al, 1993). Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks were found to occur at increased rates during small depolarizations of rat cardiac myocytes, leading to the concept that the macroscopic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] transient during larger depolarizations of  cardiac myocytes might be due to the spatio-temporal  summation of such events occurring at high frequencies throughout the myocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Cannell et al., 1993</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">L&#x000f3;pez-L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks also occur in frog skeletal muscle fibers,  both &#x0201c;spontaneously&#x0201d; in resting fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Klein et al.,  1996</xref>) and at higher frequencies during small depolarizations that produce relatively low levels of voltage activation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Tsugorka et al., 1995</xref>; Klein et al,  1996). As in cardiac myocytes, during large depolarizations of frog skeletal muscle fibers such events could  occur at much higher rates and spatio-temporally summate to compose the macroscopic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] transient.  The present perspective focuses on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in frog  skeletal muscle and the possible SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel activity that underlies the generation of the observed sparks. A central unresolved issue is whether a  spark is generated by a single channel, by a small cluster of a few channels, or by a larger strip of many contiguous channels in the SR junctional face membrane.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Observations and Interpretations</title><sec disp-level="4"><title>Spark fluorescence and the underlying time course of SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  release.</title><p>Before discussing the number of channels responsible for generating a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark, it is important to  first consider what information the spark provides concerning the underlying time course of SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release.  The signal actually monitored in studies of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks  is the change in fluorescence of a calcium indicator,  generally fluo-3, within the confocal volume in a confocal line scan image. The observed time course of fluorescence at the spatial center of a spark can be interpreted using a qualitative approach that provides a general perspective on the possible time course of the  underlying Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release and serves as a starting point  for the present considerations. During the rising phase  of a spark, the concentration of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;fluo-3 must be increasing in the confocal volume. This indicates that  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry into the confocal volume must exceed the  net effect of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> &#x0201c;removal&#x0201d; by binding and diffusion  out of the confocal volume. Thus, during the rising  phase of a spark, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions are being released from the  channel or channels responsible for generating the  spark (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A). In contrast, during the falling phase of  fluorescence in a spark, there is a net fall of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;fluo-3  in the confocal volume, indicating that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding  and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> diffusion out of the confocal volume exceed  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> entry. Since the diffusion and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding properties of the myofibril are unlikely to change significantly during the spark, the declining phase of a spark  must correspond to a period during which Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release  occurs at a much lower rate than during the rising  phase. In the extreme case, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release could occur at  an approximately constant rate during the rising phase  of the spark, and then stop completely during the falling phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, B&#x02013;D). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release turns on and off abruptly at the start and peak  of a spark.</title><p>Our recent studies using relatively high  speed (63 &#x003bc;s per line) line scan confocal imaging of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in frog skeletal muscle provide a 30-fold increase in the available temporal resolution of spark  time course and give results that are not inconsistent  with the extreme interpretation in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. These studies  demonstrate a very abrupt transition from rising to falling fluorescence at the peak of the spark, as shown by  the theoretical time course in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A, which provides a  good representation of most aspects of the observed  sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lacampagne et al., 1999</xref>). The sharp peak in  the observed spark time courses indicates a large and  abrupt decrease in the rate of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release rate at the  peak of the spark. From our results, it does not seem  implausible that release could turn off completely at  the peak of a spark. In this case, the rise time of the  spark would correspond to the total time that the channel or group of channels generating the spark were  open, and the declining phase would be a time during  which the release rate were zero. Since the high time  resolution studies also demonstrate a rather abrupt  transition to a high rate of rise of fluorescence at the  start of a spark, the level of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release activity underlying the spark also seems to achieve a near maximal  rate early in the spark rising phase. In this case, the net  level of overall release channel activity in a spark would  rapidly jump from zero to a constant rate early in the  rising phase, remain approximately constant throughout the rising phase, and then rapidly fall off to zero at  the peak of the spark. As indicated diagrammatically in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, this interpretation could correspond to a single  channel open for the entire rising phase of the spark  (B), multiple channels, each of which remain open  throughout the rising phase of the spark (C), or multiple channels that open and close asynchronously and  repeatedly during the rising phase of the spark but  close within a short interval at the time of peak of the  spark (D). In a more general interpretation, the rise time  of a spark provides a lower limit for the open time of  channels responsible for generating the spark since  some channel(s) might open or remain open during the  declining phase, even though the rate of release during  the declining phase of the spark must have been markedly less than during the rising phase (not illustrated).  The above types of interpretation can be made quantitative through the use of detailed modelling of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  binding and diffusion in a fiber after release from a  channel or group of channels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Pratusevich and  Balke, 1996</xref>). These quantitative models indicate that  release could abruptly turn on and off at the start and  peak of the observed sparks.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Properties of individual sparks are not obviously incompatible with Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from a single channel.</title><p>The Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks  detected in a frog skeletal muscle fiber have an average  rise time of 4.6 ms and an average decay time constant  of 8.6 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lacampagne et al., 1999</xref>) and an average  spatial full width at half max of &#x0223c;1.4&#x02013;1.5 &#x003bc;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Lacampagne et al., 1996</xref>). The peak change in relative fluorescence (&#x00394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>) of the larger amplitude events, which are  most likely to represent events arising spatially closest  to the scan line, is &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2. These properties, together  with the diffusion and binding properties of the fiber,  provide an indication of the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> released  by the channel or channels that generate the spark. It  was already pointed out in early reports on cardiac Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  sparks that rough approximations of the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  released in a spark were not obviously incompatible  with channel open times and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> flux rates of single  SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels in bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>). Using detailed models of the sarcomeric distribution of  myoplasmic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites together with the diffusion properties of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and fluo-3, it is possible to calculate the spatio-temporal distribution of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;fluo-3  and the resulting Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark that would be produced  by an assumed time course of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from a point  source corresponding to the channel or group of channels generating the spark. These modelling calculations, using reasonable values for the various model parameters and reasonable values for single channel current and channel open time (e.g., 1&#x02013;2 pA of current for  &#x0223c;10 ms) result in theoretical Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks that are not  obviously incompatible with the observed sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Pratusevich and Balke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>). Thus,  based on such calculations alone, it is not necessary to  exclude the possibility that a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark could be generated by the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> released during the opening of a  single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel. However, it should be  noted that this finding does not imply that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks  are in fact generated by the activity of a single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  release channel, but only establishes that the experimentally observed sparks are not obviously quantitatively inconsistent with the possibility of spark generation by a single channel. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Spark frequency increases during activation, but spark properties remain constant.</title><p>The &#x0201c;spontaneous&#x0201d; sparks observed  in frog fibers appear to be ligand-gated events triggered  by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) since the  frequency of spontaneous events increases with increased  myoplasmic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] and in the presence of caffeine  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Klein et al., 1996</xref>), and decreases with increased myoplasmic [Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Lacampagne et al., 1998</xref>), all hallmarks of CICR. The sparks initiated by fiber depolarization are voltage-activated events, presumably triggered  by activation of voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Schneider and Chandler, 1973</xref>), the dihydropyridine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Tanabe et  al., 1987</xref>) in the transverse tubule (TT) membrane of  the fibers. One of the salient features of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release by  both ligand- and voltage-activated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in frog  skeletal muscle fibers is that the overall level of calcium  release appears to be graded by variations of the frequency of occurrence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks, but that the individual sparks themselves have similar average properties despite marked differences in their frequency of  occurrence. For example, with protocols that use relatively brief repriming of chronically depolarized fibers,  the frequency of occurrence of voltage-activated events  can be modulated by both the extent of repriming and  by the membrane potential of the test depolarization  used to activate events after repriming, but neither of  these parameters appears to affect the average amplitude  or average rise time of the detected events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Lacampagne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Klein et al., 1997</xref>). Lowering myoplasmic free [Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] increases the spontaneous frequency of ligand-gated events, but does not alter the average properties of the individual events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Lacampagne  et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the average properties of the individual events appear to be quite constant despite relatively  large changes in their frequency.</p><p>An interesting implication of these observations is  that the opening rates, but not the closing rates, of the  channel(s) underlying the spark appear to be modulated during release activation. The opening rate of the  channel(s) that initiate the spark must be increased by  the voltage or ligand activation that caused the observed  increases in spark frequency since spark frequency directly reflects the rate of opening of the channels that  initiate the sparks. In contrast, the overall open time of  the channels generating the spark, and thus the effective rate of channel closing, appears to be unchanged.  The mean amplitude and rise time of the sparks should  change in parallel with any changes in the net open time  of the channels generating the spark (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), but no such  changes were observed. Net channel open time could  change without a parallel change in the observed spark  rise time only for the case of asynchronous opening of  multiple channels during the rising phase of a spark  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> D), but the spark amplitude would then still vary  with changes in the net open time of the channels underlying the spark. However, no changes in mean spark  amplitude were observed under the conditions in  which spark frequency was markedly increased. Thus,  channel closing rates do not seem to be altered under  the conditions used for voltage or ligand activation of  the sparks.</p><p>In interpreting these results, it is important to bear in  mind several technical issues. In the case of both voltage- and ligand-activated sparks, only events occurring  at relatively low frequency were examined in order to  allow relatively unambiguous identification of individual events. Even in the case of relatively low-event frequencies, there are two other technical issues to consider.  First, only events above an arbitrarily selected low-amplitude cut-off were selected for analysis. This cut-off was  imposed to avoid including possible noise as events in  the analysis of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks. Second, the amplitude of  each observed event is very sensitive to the site of origin  of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release source relative to the spatial location of the confocal scan line. Since these relative locations are completely random in our studies, a variation  of amplitude is introduced simply by the range of release site locations relative to the scan position. However, despite these two limitations, it would seem that if  the actual average amplitude of the sparks did increase  with increased frequency of occurrence, then the average  amplitude of the sparks detected above the arbitrary  cut-off amplitude and arising at random locations relative to the scan line should also have increased. Yet no  significant changes in spark amplitudes were detected  under these conditions of different spark frequencies.  Furthermore, mean spark rise time, which represents  the effective duration of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release and is less sensitive to differences in spark location relative to the scan  line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Pratusevich and Balke, 1996</xref>), was also constant  under the conditions of different spark frequencies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Possible regulation of channel opening or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release during a spark.</title><p>By analyzing sparks that occur repetitively  at particular locations at much higher rates than the average frequency over the entire fiber, the limitations of  variable spark origin and arbitrary cut-off of event amplitudes discussed in the preceding paragraph can to  a large extent be overcome. Such higher frequency events  occur spontaneously in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Parker and  Wier, 1997</xref>) and both spontaneously and during depolarization in frog skeletal muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Klein et al., 1999</xref>)  and appear to represent a repetitive mode of spark activation. If these repetitive events are generated by the  repeated opening of a given channel or small cluster of  channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Klein et al., 1999</xref>), they would all arise at the  same spatial site within the fiber. Thus, variation in spark  amplitude due to variation in the site of origin relative  to the scan line would not be a factor in the relative amplitude of the individual events within a given repetitive  train. Analysis of events in such trains indicates an unanticipated lack of smaller events, even when objective  procedures are employed to evaluate possible occurrence  of unidentified events between identified events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Klein et  al., 1999</xref>). Examination of the records of repetitive events  from cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Parker and Wier, 1997</xref>) also indicates a relative lack of smaller amplitude events. If the  sparks in a repetitive train were generated by the opening of a single channel having a single or multiple exponential open time distribution and if the spark amplitude were directly related to the channel open time,  then smaller events would actually be expected to occur  more frequently in the train than larger events. Thus, if a  single channel is responsible for generating the repetitive sparks, the observed paucity of smaller amplitude  events in repetitive trains would indicate the possibility  of some sort of regulation of the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> released by the single channel generating the spark. </p><p>Data from our recent high time resolution studies of  nonrepetitive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks may also be consistent with  regulation of the amount of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> released in a spark. In  these experiments, we have observed an inverse relationship between the mean rate of rise of fluorescence  in groups of sparks having similar rise times and the  mean spark rise time, resulting in a constant mean amplitude in groups of sparks having different rise times  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lacampagne et al., 1999</xref>). These observations are consistent with the possibility of negative feedback between  the local elevation of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] and the continuation of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from the channel or channels responsible  for generating the spark. Given the complexity of regulation of individual SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Meissner, 1994</xref>), it is not inconceivable that such feedback  regulation could occur with a single channel generating a spark. Alternatively, a relatively constant amount  of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in different events in a repetitive train  could also conceivably occur if multiple SR channels  were responsible for generating a spark.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Are two types of sparks activated during fiber depolarization?</title><p>In our original report of the existence of ligand- and  voltage-activated sparks in skeletal muscle, the observed  amplitude distributions of the sparks initiated by these  two types of mechanisms were different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Klein et al.,  1996</xref>). The spontaneous (i.e., ligand-gated) sparks appeared to correspond to a single population of events,  whereas the voltage-activated sparks appeared to correspond to one population of events having the same amplitude distribution as the spontaneous events together  with another population of events having an amplitude  distribution corresponding to approximately twice that  of the spontaneous events. The smaller amplitude voltage-activated events were attributed to the opening of a  single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel directly by interaction with the  voltage sensor. The larger amplitude events were attributed to opening of two channels, one activated directly  by the voltage sensor and a second activated by CICR  due to the locally elevated [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] in the immediate  neighborhood of the voltage-activated channel. In this  case, at least two channels would have to be involved in  generating the population of larger voltage-activated  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks. However, in subsequent studies in our laboratory, we have found no obvious differences in the  mean amplitudes of ligand- and voltage-activated sparks  in different fibers. In our initial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Klein et al., 1996</xref>),  we employed levels of activation that resulted in the occurrence of relatively large numbers of sparks at relatively high frequencies since we were searching for evidence for the existence of sparks. Although this strategy  may have been appropriate for an initial demonstration  of the existence of these events, it was not ideal for the  detailed characterization of the properties of individual  events due to the possibility of events randomly overlapping in space and time. Although the possibility of  chance overlap of random independent events was discounted in our original report, our estimate of the  probability of random overlap did not include possibly  overlapped events in the estimate of the total event rate  used for the calculation. Based on our subsequent experience, it now seems possible that the event rate during  the depolarizations in our initial study may have been  too high to permit accurate determination of the properties of isolated individual sparks. Thus, the question of  the relative amplitudes of ligand- and voltage-activated  events in the same fibers should probably be reexamined using lower event rates during fiber depolarization. </p><p>Studies using relatively small depolarizations together with pharmacological approaches to selectively  modulate a possible CICR component of voltage-activated sparks in frog skeletal muscle fibers have supported the concept of smaller events during depolarization being directly activated by the voltage sensor and  larger events having an additional contribution due to  local CICR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>). It will be important to rule out various alternative interpretations,  such as possible modulation of channel open time  and/or channel conductance or of SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> content  due to the pharmacological agent in these or other  studies using pharmacological interventions in which  changes in average properties of individual sparks are  detected. Finally, it is possible that RyR1 and RyR3, the  two different mammalian skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR) isoforms that both have homologues expressed in frog skeletal muscle, may play different roles  or release different amounts of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the generation  of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks. The failure to detect Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in  adult rat skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Shirokova et al., 1998</xref>), which  expresses only RyR1, and the observation that expression of RyR3 but not RyR1 causes the appearance of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks in myotubes from a myogenic cell line lacking any RyR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Ward et al., 1999</xref>) point to different properties of these two isoforms and to the possibility that one or more RyR3 Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels or their frog  homologue may be required for the production of a  detectable Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark in skeletal muscle. If coordinated  activity in both types of RyR channels is involved in the  generation of some sparks in frog muscle fibers, then at  least these sparks must require two or more channels. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Could a single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel trigger a multichannel release unit?</title><p>Under conditions of low average rates of occurrence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks as used in our recent experiments, it seems likely that each voltage-activated spark  is initiated by the activation of the SR channel controlled by a single TT voltage sensor and that each  ligand-activated event is initiated by the opening of a  single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel by CICR. Thus, if a  spark involves the opening of multiple SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release  channels, the single channel that opens to initiate the  spark must activate one or more neighboring channels,  presumably by CICR. These channels could in turn activate additional neighboring channels, which in principal could continue until all the SR channels along an  entire region of continuous TT&#x02013;SR junctional couplings were activated. For the typical relatively brief  sparks having a rising phase of a few milliseconds duration, it might be imagined that the propagation of activation would have to occur rapidly at the start of the rising phase, and that the rising phase would end as the  channels close in near synchrony, possibly by calcium-dependent inactivation. This general type of propagated activation scheme involving many SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels has been simulated using a model of possible local  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signalling within the TT&#x02013;SR junctional region  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Stern et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, the possibility that activity of  many SR channels coupled by CICR underlies a spark is  not theoretically inconsistent with initiation of the  spark by activation of a single channel.</p><p>In considering the possibility of propagation of activation by CICR from the SR channel to a channel along  a strip of TT&#x02013;SR junctional contact, it is relevant to reiterate that lowering myoplasmic [Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], which decreases the inhibitory influence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on CICR, increases the frequency of spontaneous sparks but does  not alter the mean amplitude or mean rise time of the  sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Lacampagne et al., 1998</xref>). These observations  indicate that the number of SR channels contributing  to a spark does not seem to be influenced by [Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>].  Thus, if propagation of activation from the SR channel  to a channel along the junctional region by local CICR  is responsible for generating the spark, the number of  channels activated by propagation along the TT&#x02013;SR  junctional strip does not seem to be significantly affected by alterations in Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> inhibition of CICR. One  explanation could be that the safety factor for propagation is sufficiently high that all SR channels in the strip  are activated at all levels of [Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] tested so that activation was essentially &#x0201c;all or none&#x0201d; at the level of an individual junctional strip. Alternatively, propagation along  the junctional strip may in fact not occur, in which case  each spontaneous spark would be generated by the  opening of only a single SR channel by CICR. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Could a single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel maintain prolonged release  in many other channels?</title><p>We have observed that application of Imperatoxin A (IpTx<sub>a</sub>) to a permeabilized frog  muscle fiber causes the appearance of prolonged Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  sparks having durations of several hundred milliseconds or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Shtifman et al., 1999</xref>). Since IpTx<sub>a</sub> is  known to produce similarly prolonged subconductance  openings (about one-third conductance of normal  channel opening) of individual SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channels incorporated in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Tripathy et al.,  1998</xref>), possibly by acting as an analogue of the 2&#x02013;3 cytoplasmic loop of the TT dihydropyridine receptor/voltage sensor, it seems likely that the prolonged sparks observed in the presence of IpTx<sub>a</sub> were generated by the  prolonged opening of a single SR channel to a subconductance state. The very long duration sparks initiated  by IpTx<sub>a</sub> were also smaller in amplitude than normal  short-duration events observed in the same fibers.  These observations raise the interesting question of  whether the prolonged toxin-induced opening of a single SR channel could maintain the opening of many  other SR channels without the other channels inactivating. Alternatively, the prolonged toxin-induced sparks  could be readily explained if toxin-induced sparks are  generated by the prolonged opening of only the single  channel interacting with the toxin. In this case, the observation that the amplitude of the toxin-induced event  is smaller then that of a brief toxin-independent spark,  together with the fact that IpTx<sub>a</sub> produces a subconductance state when applied to isolated SR channels,  could indicate that the normal sparks observed in the  absence of toxin could also be generated by the opening of a single SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel, but to the full  conductance state and only for a few milliseconds. </p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the various considerations presented above, it  does not appear that we can yet exclude the possibilities that either one or many channels are involved in  the generation of a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark. If a single channel is responsible for generating a spark, the single channel  must have appropriate feedback regulation so as to account for the reproducible spark amplitude and relative lack of small events during the repetitive spark gating mode observed at occasional triads. On the other  hand, the very prolonged small amplitude sparks observed in the presence of IpTx<sub>a</sub> are readily explained  on the basis of prolonged subconductance opening of a  single toxin-bound channel. If many channels are involved in the normal, short duration voltage- or ligand-activated spark, they would have to open and close in  close synchrony, or burst over the same few milliseconds time interval to account for the abrupt start and  peak of the observed spark time course. If many channels are involved in a short spark, it would also seem to  be necessary for a single open channel to have the capability of maintaining long duration opening of at  least some of the other channels involved in the short  spark to account for the long duration events produced  by IpTx<sub>a</sub>. It will be an interesting challenge to try to resolve these still viable important alternative possibilities  as to the channel activity pattern underlying the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  sparks observed in frog skeletal muscle. </p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Hypothetical alternative patterns of SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release  channel activity that could underlie the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks observed  in frog skeletal muscle. (A) Theoretical function representing  the relative change in fluorescence (&#x00394;<italic>F/F)</italic> as a function of  time (<italic>t</italic>) in a typical Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark.

This  function, which has discontinuous derivatives at both its start  and peak, systematically closely  followed almost all aspects of the  time course of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks recorded experimentally with video  rate recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Lacampagne et  al., 1999</xref>). The parameter values  obtained from a least squares fit  of this function to a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark  (<italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 340 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, <italic>k</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x0003d; 214 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and  <italic>d</italic><sub>2</sub> &#x02212; <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub> &#x0003d; 3.3 ms) were used to  generate the theoretical record  shown here. (B&#x02013;D) Three alternative hypothetical classes of activity  patterns, either of an individual  SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release channel (B) or  of a group of three (C) or five  (D) channels, that could underlie the observed Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> spark time  course. Each individual record  represents the time course of current (<italic>i</italic>) through a single channel, with c and o denoting the  closed and open state of the channel. Note that the time course of  total Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> efflux is approximately  the same for each channel activity pattern in B&#x02013;D. </p></caption><graphic
