The mechanisms by which ATP controls channel activation, however, are unknown. Whole cell patch  clamp was employed to begin addressing this issue. Endogenous ATP production was inhibited by dialyzing  N1E115 neuroblastoma cells for 4&#x02013;5 min with solutions containing (&#x003bc;M): 40 oligomycin, 5 iodoacetate, and 20 rotenone. The effect of ATP on current activation was observed in the absence of intracellular Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, in cells exposed to extracellular metabolic inhibitors for 25&#x02013;35 min followed by intracellular dialysis with oligomycin, iodoacetate, and rotenone, after substitution of ATP with the nonhydrolyzable analogue AMP-PNP, and in the presence of AMP-PNP and alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate intracellular proteins. These results demonstrate  that the ATP dependence of the channel requires ATP binding rather than hydrolysis and/or phosphorylation reactions. When cells were swollen at 15&#x02013;55%/min in the absence of intracellular ATP, current activation was slow  (0.3&#x02013;0.8 pA/pF per min). ATP concentration increased the rate of current activation up to maximal values of 4&#x02013;6  pA/pF per min, but had no effect on the sensitivity of the channel to cell swelling. Rate of current activation was a  saturable, hyperbolic function of ATP concentration. The EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP varied inversely with the rate of cell swelling. Activation of current was rapid (4&#x02013;6 pA/pF per min) in the absence of ATP when cells were swollen at rates  &#x02265;65%/min. Intracellular ATP concentration had no effect on current activation induced by high rates of swelling. Current activation was transient when endogenous ATP was dialyzed out of the cytoplasm of cells swollen at  15%/min. Rundown of the current was reversed by increasing the rate of swelling to 65%/min. These results indicate that the channel and/or associated regulatory proteins are capable of sensing the rate of cell volume increase. We suggest that channel activation occurs via ATP-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Increasing  the rate of cell swelling appears to increase the proportion of channels activating via the ATP-independent pathway. These findings have important physiological implications for understanding I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> regulation, the mechanisms by which cells sense volume changes, and volume homeostasis under conditions where cell metabolism is  compromised.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell volume</kwd><kwd>organic osmolytes</kwd><kwd>metabolic regulation</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Introduction"><title>introduction</title><p>Maintenance and regulation of cell volume are fundamental physiological processes.

The degree  of rectification, voltage sensitivity, and pharmacology of  I<sub>Cl, swell </sub>can vary somewhat between different cell types. It  is not clear whether the differences observed reflect the  existence of distinct channels or whether they are due  to experimental and/or physiological variables.</p><p>The mechanism by which swelling activates I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> is  unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nilius et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Okada, 1997</xref>). However, two important physiological  parameters have been shown to modulate channel activation. Changes in cytoplasmic ionic strength alter  both the rate of channel activation and channel volume sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Emma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cannon et al., 1998</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Nilius et al., 1998</xref>), and swelling-induced activation requires the presence of intracellular ATP (reviewed by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nilius et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Okada, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular ATP plays a crucial role in regulating  many ion channels and transporters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bryan and  Aguilar-Bryan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Hilgemann, 1997</xref>). In most cases,  the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of  ATP-dependent regulation are incompletely understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Hilgemann (1997)</xref> recently reviewed the mechanisms by which ATP can regulate channel/transporter  function. These mechanisms include protein and lipid  phosphorylation, ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, modulation of cytoskeletal function, chelation of polyvalent  cations, and modulation of membrane trafficking.</p><p>The mechanisms of ATP-dependent regulation of the  I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel are largely unknown. Most studies of I<sub>Cl,  swell</sub> have shown that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues  readily substitute for intracellular ATP, suggesting that  the requirement for ATP involves binding rather than  phosphorylation or hydrolysis reactions (reviewed by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nilius et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Okada, 1997</xref>).  However, studies in cultured mouse cortical collecting  duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>) and carotid body  type I cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers, 1997</xref>) indicate that  phosphorylation of the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel and/or accessory  proteins is required for swelling-induced activation.</p><p>In the present investigation, we demonstrate that I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>  activation in N1E115 neuroblastoma cells does not involve ATP hydrolysis or phosphorylation reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ATP dependence of  the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel is modulated by the rate of cell volume change. At high rates of swelling, I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activates  rapidly and activation is insensitive to intracellular ATP  concentration. Our results indicate that there are ATP-dependent and -independent mechanisms by which  I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> can be activated. In addition, they demonstrate  that cells sense not only the magnitude of volume  change, but also the rate at which volume is perturbed.  These findings have important physiological implications for control of both cell volume and metabolic homeostasis, and they provide new insights into regulation of the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel.</p></sec><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>N1E115 mouse neuroblastoma cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO  BRL</named-content>) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml  streptomycin, and 25 mM HEPES in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/ 95% air.

Sodium and K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-free bath and pipette solutions were used to minimize the contribution of cation currents to the whole cell conductance. To prevent spontaneous cell swelling, the osmolality of  the pipette solution was hypotonic (280 mOsm) with respect to  the bath. Metabolic inhibitors were added from concentrated  stock solutions dissolved in DMSO. Final DMSO concentration in  the pipette solutions was 0.15%. ATP and ATP analogues were  added as sodium and lithium salts, respectively. Electrodes had DC  resistances of 3&#x02013;5 m&#x003a9;.

Electrical connections to the amplifier  were made using Ag/AgCl pellets and 3 M KCl/agar bridges.

However, in carotid body type 1 and mouse cortical collecting duct cells, phosphorylation reactions appear to  be needed for channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers, 1997</xref>). The reason for  these contradictory findings is unclear and we therefore carried out a series of experiments to look more  closely at the role of phosphorylation.</p><p>In their studies on cortical collecting duct cells,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher (1996)</xref> exposed cells to extracellular metabolic inhibitors for 20&#x02013;45 min before they  were patch clamped. Such prolonged metabolic inhibition may result in dephosphorylation of the channel  and/or other proteins. If the putative phosphorylation  of these proteins is crucial to channel function, then intracellular ATP rather than nonhydrolyzable analogues  would be required for swelling-induced activation. We  therefore pretreated N1E115 neuroblastoma cells with  5 mM 2-deoxyglucose and 100 nM rotenone for 25&#x02013;35  min, and then patch clamped them with the standard  pipette solution containing (&#x003bc;M) 40 oligomycin, 5 iodoacetate, and 20 rotenone. Both 2-deoxyglucose and  rotenone were present in the bath throughout the entire experiment. Cells were dialyzed for 4&#x02013;5 min with  the metabolic inhibitors before swelling was induced.  Preliminary studies demonstrated that a dialysis period  of 2&#x02013;3 min was sufficient to maximally inhibit swelling-induced current activation, presumably by maximally  reducing intracellular ATP levels.</p><p>In the presence of intracellular metabolic inhibitors  and ATP or ATP analogues, an outwardly rectifying (data  not shown) current was activated when cells were swollen by reduction of bath osmolality. With 73 and 125 mM  Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> in the bath and pipette solutions, respectively, the  mean &#x000b1; SEM E<sub>rev</sub> observed was 13.1 &#x000b1; 0.3 mV (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d;  109). This value is close to the value of 12.8 mV predicted from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and  the previously measured relative cation conductance  (<italic>P</italic><sub>cation</sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>Cl</sub>) of 0.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Jackson and Strange, 1993</xref>). These  results indicate that the current activated by swelling is  a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> current (i.e., I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>).</p><p>Results of the metabolic inhibition studies are shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A. When exposed to intracellular metabolic inhibitors alone, and a Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-free pipette solution containing 2 mM ATP, the mean &#x000b1; SEM rate of chloride  current activation measured at &#x0002b;60 mV was 3.95 &#x000b1; 0.26  pA/pF per min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 28). This value was not significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1) different from those obtained in cells  pretreated for 25&#x02013;35 min with 2-deoxyglucose and rotenone, and then dialyzed with metabolic inhibitors in  the presence of 2 mM ATP and 0 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or 2 mM  ATP and 2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). </p><p>As a further test for the involvement of phosphorylation in regulating I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>, we patch clamped cells with a  pipette solution containing alkaline phosphatase. As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B, there was no significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.8) difference in the rate of swelling-induced current activation in the presence of 2 mM ATP and 0 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, 2 mM  AMP-PNP, and 0 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, or 2 mM AMP-PNP, 0 mM  Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and 30 U/ml of alkaline phosphatase. We conclude from the results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> that swelling- induced activation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> in N1E115 neuroblastoma  cells requires only ATP binding, and not phosphorylation events and/or ATP hydrolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>The Rate of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> Activation Is a Saturable Function of  Intracellular ATP Concentration</title><p>To further characterize the dependence of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation on ATP binding, we quantified the effect of ATP  concentration on the rate of current activation, the  rate of cell swelling, and the cell volume set-point of  the channel simultaneously in single patch-clamped  cells. We define cell volume set-point as the relative cell  volume at which current activation is initiated (see Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In initial experiments, cells were swollen at a rate of  35&#x02013;40%/min via reduction of bath osmolality by 100  mOsm (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>  (right), intracellular ATP concentration had no effect  on the rate of cell swelling. The rate of current activation, however, was increased by increasing ATP levels in  the patch pipette solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, left). The rate of current activation was a saturable function of intracellular  ATP concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The maximal rate of current activation (<italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>) was 4.11 pA/pF per min and the  EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP was 0.32 mM. The cell volume set-point of  the channel was 1.09&#x02013;1.15 and was unaffected by ATP  concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, inset, and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).    </p><p>With prolonged exposure to hypotonic medium,  N1E115 cells underwent dramatic volume increases  (see Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The ability to withstand such large  degrees of swelling most likely reflects the presence of  extensive membrane microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Walum and Marchner,  1983</xref>) and possibly membrane infolding. Similar large  volume increases have been observed in patch-clamped  lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Ross et al., 1994</xref>) and have been attributed to the presence of numerous microvilli that amplify the total membrane surface area. </p><p>It is likely that ATP-consuming reactions are active in  patch-clamped cells. These reactions may occur at a  rate that approaches the rate of ATP diffusion from the  patch pipette solution. Thus, it was conceivable that  ATP-consuming reactions close to the channel and/or  its activation machinery may have reduced local ATP  concentrations, resulting in an overestimation of the  concentration of the nucleotide required for any given  rate of current activation. To address this important issue, we dialyzed cells with an ATP regeneration system  consisting of 10 mM creatine phosphate and 80 U/ml  of creatine kinase. The solution also contained 0.25 mM  ATP. This concentration was close to the EC<sub>50</sub>, and was  chosen so that small increases in ATP concentration  potentially brought about by the regeneration system  would be detected as relatively large increases in the  rate of current activation. The rate of current activation  in the presence of the ATP regeneration system (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>,  &#x025a1;) was not significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.15) different from that  observed with 0.25 mM ATP alone. We conclude that  the ATP concentration sensed by the channel and/or  its regulatory machinery is similar to that in the bulk  pipette solution.</p><p>Surprisingly, swelling-induced activation of an outwardly rectifying anion current was also detected in  metabolically poisoned cells dialyzed with an ATP-free  pipette solution, albeit at a greatly reduced rate (Figs.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The mean &#x000b1; SEM rate of current activation observed was 0.44 &#x000b1; 0.09 pA/pF per min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10). This  suggested that the cells may contain trace amounts of  ATP. To test for this possibility, we dialyzed cells for  5&#x02002;&#x02009;&#x02009;min with an ATP-free pipette solution containing  metabolic inhibitors and the ATP-consuming enzyme  apyrase. Apyrase was present at a concentration of 2 U/ ml. Concentrations of apyrase of 0.5&#x02013;1 U/ml have been  shown previously to be effective in depleting both intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Wang et al., 1996</xref>) and extracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Schwiebert et al., 1995</xref>) ATP. The presence of apyrase had no  significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.25) effect on the rate of current activation (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, &#x022c4;, and 5, bottom two traces plotted with  &#x025cb; and &#x02022;). </p><p>The observation that a small amount of current is activated in the absence of intracellular ATP is consistent  with findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Volk et al. (1996)</xref>. These investigators  noted that swelling-induced anion current activation  required intracellular ATP when inner medullary collecting duct cells were swollen by a 50-mOsm reduction  in bath. In contrast, when swelling was induced by 100-mOsm reduction in bath osmolality, an ATP-independent anion current was activated.</p><p>Given these results, we examined the effect of increasing the rate of swelling on the ATP dependence of  I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>. N1E115 cells were dialyzed for 4&#x02013;5 min with an  ATP-free pipette solution containing metabolic inhibitors, and then exposed to a 150-mOsm reduction in  bath. Under these conditions, the cells swelled at a rate  of 65&#x02013;70%/min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). As shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>  and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, cell swelling induced a rapid increase in whole  cell current. The mean &#x000b1; SEM E<sub>rev</sub> for the current was  12.8 &#x000b1; 1.2 mV (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17), indicating that it is carried by  Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. The mean &#x000b1; SEM rate of current activation was  5.0 &#x000b1; 0.8 pA/pF per min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 17). Addition of 2 U/ml  of apyrase to the patch pipette solution had no significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.4) effect on the rate of current activation  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, top two traces plotted with &#x025b5; and &#x025b4;). Activation of the ATP-independent current was reversed  by&#x02002;cell shrinkage. Exposure of swollen cells to a 300-mOsm bath solution induced cell shrinkage and a  rapid reduction in whole cell current (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>; see also  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B).  </p><p>To determine whether the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel was responsible for this ATP-independent current, we compared its biophysical and pharmacological characteristics to the current activated by a 100-mOsm reduction  in bath in metabolically poisoned cells dialyzed with 2 mM  ATP. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TIII">III</xref>, both currents had similar  reversal potentials, rectification and voltage sensitivity,  and were inhibited in a voltage-dependent manner and  to the same extent by 100 &#x003bc;M DIDS (4,4&#x02032;-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2&#x02032;-disulfonate). In addition, the channels  responsible for the currents had similar relative anion  permeabilities.

There was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e;  0.2) between rates of current activation measured in  the presence of different intracellular concentrations  of ATP. Therefore, at high rates of cell swelling, current activation is insensitive to cytoplasmic ATP levels.  The cell volume set-point of the channel was also unaffected by ATP concentration and was similar to that observed in cells swollen more slowly with smaller hypotonic shocks (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).<sup>3</sup> </p><p>The effect of high rates of swelling on the ATP sensitivity of current activation suggested that it would also  be altered by slower rates of cell swelling.

When cells were  swollen at a rate of 13&#x02013;17%/min by a 50-mOsm hypotonic shock, current activation was again a saturable  function of ATP concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), but both the  EC<sub>50</sub> (0.8 mM) and <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> (1.37 pA/pF per min) were  dramatically altered compared with cells swollen by a  100-mOsm reduction in bath (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).

Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A shows the rate of current activation in metabolically poisoned cells dialyzed with an  ATP-free pipette solution (i.e., ATP-independent current activation). I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation was relatively slow  (0.26&#x02013;0.44 pA/pF per min) when the rate of cell swelling was 15&#x02013;40%/min (50&#x02013;100-mOsm reductions in  bath). The rates of ATP-independent current activation  observed under these conditions were not significantly  different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.3), indicating that they were relatively  insensitive to the rate of cell volume increase.

Importantly, current activation under these conditions was still a saturable function of intracellular ATP concentration (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><p>ATP-independent current activation increased dramatically to &#x0223c;5 pA/pF per min when the rate of cell  swelling was increased to 65&#x02013;70%/min (150-mOsm reduction in bath). Increasing the rate of cell swelling to  100%/min (200-mOsm reduction in bath)<sup>4</sup> had no further effect on the rate of ATP-independent current activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A).</p><p>The EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP varied inversely with the rate of cell  swelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B). At low rates of swelling, half maximal rates of current activation required higher concentrations of ATP compared with that observed in cells  swollen at higher rates. <italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub> was a direct function of the  rate of cell swelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> C).</p></sec><sec><title>Current Rundown</title><p>Transient activation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> has been observed in several cell types when they are patch clamped with ATP-free solutions and activated shortly after obtaining the  whole cell configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lewis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jackson et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Oike et al., 1994</xref>). This &#x0201c;rundown&#x0201d; of the current  is prevented when the pipette solution contains ATP or  ATP analogues. The simplest interpretation of these  findings is that current activation is initially supported  by the presence of endogenous ATP. As this ATP is dialyzed away, the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channels spontaneously inactivate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lewis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jackson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Oike  et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether N1E115 neuroblastoma cells also  exhibited such rundown behavior, we patch clamped  cells with an ATP-free pipette solution containing metabolic inhibitors.

The activation  was transient, however, and the current slowly inactivated despite continued volume increase.</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B shows the effect of increasing the rate of  swelling on current rundown. The cell shown in the figure was initially swollen at a rate of 12%/min by exposure to a 50-mOsm reduction in bath. Current activation was initiated at a relative cell volume of 1.04 and  spontaneous rundown was observed when the relative  cell volume was 1.38. Approximately 5 min after rundown began, relative cell volume was 1.8, and the cell  was then swollen at a rate of 63%/min by exposure to a  150-mOsm reduction in bath. Rapid current reactivation occurred immediately upon switching the solution.  Similar experiments were carried out in five additional  cells. In all cases, exposure to a 150-mOsm reduction in  bath induced a rapid reactivation of current (data not  shown). The amount of additional swelling that occurred before current reactivation was initiated was between 6 and 12% in three cells. In three other cells,  current reactivation was initiated immediately after the  solution switch and it was not possible to accurately  measure the cell volume change at which it occurred.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>discussion</title><sec><title>Role of Phosphorylation in I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> Activation</title><p>Most studies of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation that have examined  channel ATP dependence have concluded that nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues substitute normally for ATP  (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nilius et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Okada, 1997</xref>). However, studies in cultured mouse cortical collecting duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>)  and carotid body type I cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers,  1997</xref>) have shown that activation only occurs with ATP  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers,  1997</xref>) or ATP&#x003b3;S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>), that it  requires the presence of intracellular Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer  and&#x02002;Korbmacher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers, 1997</xref>),  which is needed for kinase activity, and that it can be  inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>). These results have  been interpreted as indicating that phosphorylation of  the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel and/or accessory proteins is required for swelling-induced activation.</p><p>The reasons for the contradictory findings on the  role of intracellular ATP are unclear. One possibility is  that methodological differences may unmask constitutive phosphorylation of the channel and/or accessory  proteins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher (1996)</xref> exposed collecting duct cells to metabolic inhibitors for 20&#x02013;45 min  before they were patch clamped. Such prolonged metabolic inhibition is likely to lead to dephosphorylation  of the channel and/or important regulatory proteins.  If phosphorylation were crucial to the function of these  proteins, rephosphorylation by ATP would have to occur before the channel could be activated by swelling  and ATP binding. Our findings do not support this hypothesis, however. Channel activation is normal in  cells exposed to prolonged metabolic inhibition after  they were dialyzed with Mg-free pipette solutions containing 2 mM ATP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A). Furthermore, channel activation is unaffected by dialyzing metabolically poisoned cells with Mg-free solutions containing 2 mM  AMP-PNP and 30 U/ml of alkaline phosphatase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>  B) to dephosphorylate proteins. We conclude therefore that in N1E115 neuroblastoma cells, activation of  I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> requires ATP binding rather than hydrolysis  and/or phosphorylation reactions. The requirement  for phosphorylation observed in other cell types  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carpenter and Peers,  1997</xref>) may reflect the existence of distinct channel  types. Alternatively, it may reflect the existence of multiple signaling/regulatory pathways involved in swelling-induced channel activation. These pathways could  be cell-specific, they may reflect the physiological status  of the cell, and/or they may be sensitive to experimental  parameters such as solution composition<sup>3</sup> and the mechanism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Strange, 1994</xref>) or rate of cell swelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Characteristics of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> Activation</title><p>There are several aspects of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel activation  that bear on the discussion of the modulatory role of  intracellular ATP. First, it is important to note that  graded increases in cell volume do not activate I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>  by inducing graded changes in the <italic>P</italic><sub>o </sub>of a single, homogeneous population of channels. Instead, channels exist in either an inactive state where <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0003d; 0, or an active  state where <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0223c; 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Jackson and Strange, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Boese  et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and Korbmacher, 1996</xref>). Swelling increases the number, <italic>n</italic>, of active channels in the cell  membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Jackson and Strange, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Meyer and  Korbmacher, 1996</xref>), and <italic>n</italic> is therefore a direct function of the magnitude of the volume increase.</p><p>I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> can be activated by forcing fluid into a cell via  the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cannon et al., 1998</xref>). This indicates  that activation does not require transmembrane water  flow or the presence of an osmotic gradient. Spontaneous channel activation does not occur with prolonged dialysis of the cell, suggesting that dilution of a freely diffusible factor is not involved. Activation only requires expansion of the cell volume. Thus, activation must  ultimately involve mechanical events. These mechanical  events may be detected directly by the channel and/or  associated regulatory proteins. Putative regulatory proteins may include components of the cytoskeleton that  are altered by cell swelling. Alternatively, cell swelling  may alter the activity of signal transduction pathways that  ultimately are responsible for activating the channel.</p><p>When using whole cell patch clamp to study I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>,  current activation can be characterized in terms of a  cell volume set-point of the channel and a rate of current activation. Cell volume set-point is defined as the  relative cell volume at which current activation is detected and is a measure of the sensitivity of the channels to swelling. The set-point is regulated by intracellular ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Emma et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Cannon et al.,  1998</xref>) and G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Voets et al., 1998</xref>). The fact that  <italic>n</italic> increases as a direct function of the amount of cell  swelling suggests that individual channels or groups of  channels have different cell volume set-points. Alternatively, macroscopic cell swelling may have different effects  on the mechanical properties of microdomains within  the plasma membrane or in submembrane structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Modulation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> Activation by Intracellular ATP</title><p>It has been concluded previously that ATP is an essential cofactor for swelling-induced activation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>  (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Nilius et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Okada, 1997</xref>). However, as shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, Table  <xref ref-type="table" rid="TIII">III</xref>, and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Volk et al. (1996)</xref>, current activation can be  observed under ATP-free conditions. With rates of  swelling between 15 and 55%/min, increases in intracellular ATP increase the rate of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation without changing the cell volume set-point of the channel  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). The rate of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation is a saturable function of ATP concentration, which can be defined as an EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP and a maximal rate of current  activation (<italic>R</italic><sub>max</sub>) at saturating ATP levels (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>,  and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Two conclusions can be drawn from these observations. First, ATP interacts with a saturable binding  site(s) that selectively recognizes the nucleotide and  certain analogues. Second, ATP binding induces a conformational change(s) in the channel and/or regulatory proteins that is required for channel activation.  The rate at which this conformational change, and  hence current activation, occurs is a saturable function  of ATP concentration.</p><p>Rundown of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> occurs when endogenous ATP is  dialyzed out of the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). This indicates  that ATP is required to maintain the channel and/or  regulatory proteins in the activated conformation. Thus,  ATP must be bound to the activated channel and/or  regulatory proteins.</p><p>One of the more novel findings of our studies is that  the rate of cell swelling alters channel ATP sensitivity  (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). As the rate of cell swelling is increased, the EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP falls (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). At high  rates of volume increase, I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation is insensitive  to intracellular ATP concentration (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>How does the rate of cell swelling modulate the ATP  dependence of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation? There are two obvious models to consider. First, the rate of cell swelling  could somehow change the affinity of the ATP binding  site(s). Alternatively, channel activation may occur via  distinct ATP-dependent and -independent pathways.</p><p>Changes in ATP affinity cannot explain all of the experimental observations adequately. As shown in Figs.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, ATP-independent current activation occurs, albeit slowly, at rates of cell swelling (15&#x02013;55%/ min) where there is a strong dependence of current activation on intracellular ATP concentration. Furthermore, if ATP affinity were a function of the rate of volume expansion, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of the binding site will fall as the  rate of swelling is increased. However, this effect would  have to be reversed at high rates of swelling where current activation is independent of intracellular ATP concentration (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Indeed, it would be necessary to postulate that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for ATP rises to infinity  (i.e., the site is no longer capable of binding ATP)  when cells are swollen at &#x02265;65%/min.</p><p>The alternative and, in our opinion, simpler explanation for the observed changes in ATP sensitivity is that  the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel can be activated via distinct ATP- dependent and -independent mechanisms. Swelling- induced changes in the EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP can be explained  if increases in the rate of cell swelling increase the proportion of channels activating in the ATP-independent  mode. As the rate of swelling is increased, less ATP  would be needed (i.e., the EC<sub>50</sub> for ATP would fall) to  drive a given rate of current activation.</p><p>The results of our studies have important implications for understanding the regulation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>. It is  entirely possible that channel activation is modulated  by multiple factors and signal transduction pathways.  The physiological status of the cell, as well as experimental variables such as the rate and mechanism of  swelling, and the magnitude of the volume increase  may determine which factors and signaling pathways  control channel activation. This possibility needs to be  taken into account in the design and interpretation of  future studies of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> regulation.</p><p>Clearly, extensive additional biophysical and cellular  studies are required to test the models described above.  A complete understanding of the ATP dependence of  the channel ultimately requires molecular identification  of the pore-forming and associated regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>How Is the Rate of Cell Swelling Sensed?</title><p>An important finding of these studies is the demonstration that the rate of cell swelling alters the ATP requirement of the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). How  does a cell sense the rate at which its volume is changing? One possibility is that rate per se is not sensed, but  instead there is some critical volume that is reached  more rapidly at higher rates of swelling. This critical volume could in turn determine whether the channel activates via the ATP-independent pathway. The data in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref> argue strongly against this possibility. When cells  were swollen at 65&#x02013;70%/min (150-mOsm reduction in  bath) in the absence of intracellular ATP, the cell volume set-point of the channel was 1.14. This value is not  significantly different from those observed under all  other experimental conditions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). Furthermore,  in cells that are exhibiting current rundown, current  can be reactivated rapidly at various times after rundown begins simply by increasing the rate of swelling to  65&#x02013;70%/min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). Taken together, these results  indicate that the cells are sensing the rate of volume increase and not some absolute volume change.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms responsible for sensing  the rate of cell swelling are completely unknown. However, it is interesting to speculate that the cytoskeleton  may play an important role. Numerous studies have  demonstrated that the cytoskeleton undergoes structural reorganization in response to mechanical forces.  These changes can occur on a time scale of seconds to  minutes and appear to play important roles in fundamental processes such as maintenance of cell shape,  cell locomotion, mechanosensitivity, and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Choquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Hamill and McBride,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Ingber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Chicurel et al., 1998</xref>). </p><p>It is reasonable to postulate that the mechanical stress  associated with cell swelling may also induce changes in  cytoskeletal organization. These putative changes could  be important for maintaining plasma membrane&#x02013;cytoskeleton interactions, the spatial organization of membrane and submembrane proteins, and the overall mechanical properties of the cell. If the rate of volume  perturbation was more rapid than the rate at which cytoskeletal reorganization could take place, it is easy to  envision that protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;membrane  interactions might be altered. Changes in protein&#x02013;protein interactions could in turn modulate the ATP dependence, as well as other aspects of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation.  Assessment of the role of the cytoskeleton in regulation  of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> will require extensive additional investigation  using electrophysiological, pharmacological, molecular, and biophysical approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Significance of ATP-dependent Channel Regulation</title><p>Volume regulatory efflux of structurally diverse organic  osmolytes appears to occur primarily via the I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>  channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Kirk and Strange, 1998</xref>). In addition, the  channel is highly permeable to important metabolic intermediates such as pyruvate, the short-chain fatty acids  acetate, and butyrate, the ketone body &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, and several amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jackson et al., 1994</xref>).  These metabolites are major inputs into the tricarboxylic  acid cycle. Because of its high organic solute permeability, we have suggested previously that modulation of  I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> channel activation by ATP levels may function as  an important feedback regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jackson  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Strange et al., 1996</xref>). Unregulated loss of cellular metabolites would likely disrupt cellular energy production. Regulation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> by cellular ATP levels could  therefore prevent depletion of energy-producing carbon  sources when cellular energy production is reduced.</p><p>I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> activation has been invoked as an important  component of cellular volume regulation when cells are  swollen by anoxic and ischemic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Kimelberg, 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Roy, 1995</xref>). We have argued previously that the requirement for intracellular ATP would rule out or diminish such  a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Jackson et al., 1994</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Patel et al., 1998</xref>).  However, as we have demonstrated here, it is clearly  possible to activate the channel in the absence of ATP.</p><p>In patch-clamped cells, channel activation via the  ATP-independent pathway is controlled by the rate of  volume increase. Other factors may control activation  by this pathway as well. Whether the ATP dependence  of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> is modulated in intact cells is uncertain and  deserves further study. If such modulation occurs, it is  interesting to speculate on its physiological significance. As noted above, activation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> in a metabolically compromised cell may further compromise  metabolism and lead to additional disruption of cellular functions. Thus, if swelling is not too severe, it may  be beneficial to the cell to protect its metabolism at the  expense of volume homeostasis. On the other hand, if  swelling is extreme and membrane lysis is imminent,  volume control may take precedence over energy metabolism. We suggest that the modulation of channel  ATP dependence may be an adaptation that allows cells  to cope with the potentially competing demands of preservation of energy metabolism and volume regulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example of simultaneous current and volume measurements performed on a single, patch-clamped cell.

ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> revealed that there was a linear relationship between the rate of cell swelling and reductions in bath osmolality of 50&#x02013;200 mOsm. However, the line intersected the x axis at &#x0223c;20  mOsm, instead of 0 mOsm as expected. This suggests that there is a  resistance to cell swelling with osmotic gradients &#x0003c;20 mOsm. The  reason for this resistance to swelling with small hypotonic shocks is  uncertain. It should be emphasized, however, that it does not effect  the interpretation of results presented in this paper.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><label>3</label><p>It is noteworthy that the effect of a high rate of cell swelling on ATP  sensitivity was altered by intracellular solution composition. During  the course of these studies, the cells developed a nonselective cation  conductance that interfered with measurements of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub>. This conductance was eliminated by replacing CsCl in either the bath alone,  or in both the bath and patch pipette solution with NMDG-Cl. However, in the presence of intracellular NMDG-Cl, ATP-independent activation of I<sub>Cl, swell</sub> did not occur when cells were swollen by exposure  to a 150-mOsm reduction in bath osmolality (data not shown). The  nature of this effect of intracellular NMDG-Cl is unknown.</p></fn><fn id="FN4"><label>4</label><p>It was necessary to reduce bath NMDG-Cl concentration from 70 to  40 mM to reduce the osmolality by 200 mOsm. The mean &#x000b1; SEM E<sub>rev</sub>  of the current observed in cells exposed to this solution was 22.3 &#x000b1;  0.8 mV (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 7). The expected E<sub>rev</sub> calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation is 25.1 mV. In experiments where bath  NMDG-Cl concentration was 70 mM, whole cell currents were quantified at &#x0002b;60 mV, which is 47 mV above the calculated E<sub>rev</sub>. Therefore,  whole cell currents were quantified at &#x0002b;72 mV in cells bathed with 40  mM NMDG-Cl.</p></fn><fn><p>Control experiments were performed to determine if the reduction in bath salt concentration altered current activation. Cells were  exposed to a bath solution containing 40 mM NMDG-Cl and osmolality was reduced by 150 mOsm. The mean &#x000b1; SEM rate of current activation in these cells was 4.8 &#x000b1; 1.4 pA/pF per min (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3). This value  was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1) from that observed in cells  swollen in the presence of 70 mM NMDG-Cl. </p></fn></fn-group></back></article>
