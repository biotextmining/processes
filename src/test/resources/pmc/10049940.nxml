Therefore, the antigens encoded by <italic>MAGE</italic>-type genes are strictly  tumor specific and common to many tumors. We describe here the identification of the first  <italic>MAGE</italic>-encoded epitopes presented by histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II  molecules to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were loaded with a  MAGE-3 recombinant protein and used to stimulate autologous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. We isolated  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones that recognized two different MAGE-3 epitopes, MAGE-3<sub>114&#x02013;127</sub> and  MAGE-3<sub>121&#x02013;134</sub>, both presented by the HLA-DR13 molecule, which is expressed in 20% of  Caucasians. The second epitope is also encoded by <italic>MAGE-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, and -<italic>6</italic>. Our procedure  should be applicable to other proteins for the identification of new tumor-specific antigens presented by HLA class II molecules. The knowledge of such antigens will be useful for evaluation  of the immune response of cancer patients immunized with proteins or with recombinant viruses carrying entire genes coding for tumor antigens. The use of antigenic peptides presented  by class II in addition to peptides presented by class I may also improve the efficacy of therapeutic antitumor vaccination.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>invariant chain</kwd><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>tumor</kwd><kwd>histocompatibility leukocyte antigen  class II</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>From cultures of blood lymphocytes or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of cancer patients stimulated with autologous tumor cells, it is possible to isolate CTLs that  show specificity for tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These CTLs have  been used as tools to isolate genes that code for tumor antigens, such as those of the <italic>MAGE</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The  MAGE antigens are of particular interest for cancer immunotherapy because of their strict tumoral specificity and because they are shared by many tumors. <italic>MAGE</italic> genes are  activated in tumors of many different histological types.  They are silent in normal cells, except in testicular germ  cells, which do not express MHC class I molecules and are  therefore incapable of presenting antigens to CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).  Other families of genes with the same pattern of expression  have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In addition to the genes identified with the approach involving antitumor CTLs, several  other <italic>MAGE</italic>-type genes, i.e., genes expressed only in tumors and in male germline cells, have been identified by  purely genetic approaches or by the use of antibodies  present in the sera of cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). As a result,  there is now a large supply of sequences potentially coding  for tumor-specific shared antigens.</p><p>Among the <italic>MAGE</italic> genes, <italic>MAGE-3</italic> is one of the most  frequently expressed in tumors. For instance, it is expressed  in 76% of metastatic melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Five antigenic peptides presented by class I molecules have been identified in  the MAGE-3 protein. They are presented to CTLs by  HLA-A1, -A2 (two epitopes), -A24, and -B44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).  Some of these epitopes were identified as targets of CTL  clones obtained by stimulation of T lymphocytes with autologous tumor cells. Others were identified by &#x0201c;reverse  immunology&#x0201d; approaches, based on the knowledge of gene  sequences and in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes of noncancerous individuals with candidate peptides considered  likely to bind to a given HLA. <italic>MAGE-3</italic> codes for a protein of 315 amino acids, and it is very likely that many  other peptides derived from MAGE-3 bind to various HLA  molecules and hence could be additional target antigens for  an antitumor CTL response.</p><p>So far, the identification of tumor antigens has focused  mainly on antigens recognized by CTLs, almost all of  which are CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, even though the importance of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells in antitumor response has been demonstrated in numerous animals models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Only a few examples of  antigens recognized by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells on human tumors  have been described. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells that were raised in vitro  against a peptide centered on the fusion region of bcr-abl  were found to recognize HLA-DR4 leukemic blasts expressing bcr-abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The same approach had been previously used to identify an epitope presented by HLA-DQ7  molecules in a mutated region of K-<italic>ras</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Antigenic  peptides encoded by the melanocyte differentiation proteins tyrosinase and gp100 have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>No antigen presented by a class II molecule has yet been  reported for a <italic>MAGE-</italic>type gene. In an attempt to characterize such an antigen for <italic>MAGE-3</italic>, we used monocyte- derived dendritic cells loaded with a MAGE-3 recombinant  protein to stimulate autologous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.

The full-length MAGE-3 sequence, preceded by the amino acid (aa)<sup>1</sup> sequence MHHHHHHHGG, was engineered into a vector bearing the pMB1 replicon and the PL short promoter. This vector  was used to transform <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain AR58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Bacteria  were grown in LB medium containing 50 &#x003bc;g/ml kanamycin at  30&#x000b0;C. After heat induction, the MAGE-3 expression product became detectable as a 46-kD band when assayed by Western blot  (SDS-PAGE 12.5%; revealed by a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to  MAGE-3). Protein purification was carried out at room temperature, and involved the following steps: cell lysis and centrifugation, repeated washing of the centrifugation pellet followed by  solubilization of the pellet containing MAGE-3, immobilized  metal ion affinity chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, concentration, and dialysis. The resulting MAGE-3 protein was &#x0003e;95% pure, as assessed by Coomassie blue staining.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Construction of pMFG-Ii.MAGE-3.</title><p>The plasmid IipSV51L,  containing a cDNA encoding the human invariant chain (Ii), was  provided by Dr. J.

The MFG retroviral  vector is derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus,  which lacks a drug resistance marker and does not express any  other potential antigenic protein except for the inserted cDNA  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The cDNA encoding the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end (i.e., the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane region) of the human  (hu)-Ii polypeptide (residues 1&#x02013;80) was amplified by PCR using  IipSV51L as the template. The following primers were used:  hu-Ii sense, 5&#x02032;-TTT<italic>CCATGG</italic>ATGACCAGCGCGAC-3&#x02032;, and  hu-Ii antisense, 5&#x02032;-TTT<italic>GGATCC</italic>GGAAGCTTCATGCGCAGGTTC-3&#x02032; (the recognition sites for NcoI and BamHI are in italics). The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced.  The NcoI-BamHI amplification product was cloned into pMFG  and opened with the enzymes NcoI and BamHI, resulting in  pMFG-Ii. A BglII recognition site, replacing the ATG codon and  in frame with the BamHI site at the 3&#x02032; end of the truncated  Ii-cDNA, was introduced at the 5&#x02032; end of the MAGE-3 cDNA  by PCR using the following primers: BglII sense, 5&#x02032;-TTT<italic>AGATCT</italic>TGAGCAGAGGAGTCAGC-3&#x02032;, and BglII antisense:  5&#x02032;-CCC<italic>AGATCT</italic>TCACTCTTCCCCCTCTCTC-3&#x02032; (the recognition sites for BglII are in italics). The PCR product (BglII.  MAGE-3.BglII) was cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The  recombinant plasmid, pMFG-Ii, was reopened with BamHI, and  the BglII.MAGE-3.BglII amplification product was ligated to the  compatible ends.

The transfection procedure is a modification  of the calcium phosphate&#x02013;mediated transfection protocol of Graham and Van der Eb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). 24 h before transfection, PhoenixAMPHO cells were plated in cell growth medium in a 75-cm<sup>2</sup> tissue  culture flask (Falcon; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="becton">Becton Dickinson Labware</named-content>).

At the time of transfection, when the  cells should have reached a confluence of 70&#x02013;80%, the medium  was removed and replaced by 14 ml fresh PhoenixAMPHO cell  growth medium containing 25 mM chloroquine (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>). A  transfection cocktail was prepared in a 50-ml tube by adding 40 &#x003bc;g  retroviral vector plasmid DNA to water and diluting to 1,575 &#x003bc;l  final vol.

The DNA/ CaCl<sub>2</sub>/HeBS mix was added immediately in drops onto the cells,  and the flask was gently swirled to ensure uniform mixing of  DNA/CaPO<sub>4</sub> particles. The cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C/5%  CO<sub>2</sub> for 7&#x02013;9 h, and the chloroquine-containing medium was  changed for fresh PhoenixAMPHO cell growth medium. Approximately 24 h before the harvest of the retroviral supernatant,  the PhoenixAMPHO medium was removed and gently replaced  by 9 ml of IMDM containing only 2.5% FCS. The retroviral supernatant was harvested 48 h after transfection by removing the  medium from the cells and filtering through a 0.45-&#x003bc;m filter to  remove cell debris. After harvest and filtration, the virus-containing medium was kept on ice, aliquoted in appropriate volumes in  15-ml polypropylene tubes, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Retroviral Transduction of Cell Lines.</title><p>Target cells were resuspended in 60-mm tissue culture plates (Falcon) at a density of 10<sup>6</sup>  cells in 4 ml of infection cocktail containing 50% viral supernatant in growth medium and 6 &#x003bc;g/ml of protamine sulfate.

The responder T cells received three additional weekly restimulations with dendritic cells pulsed with protein MAGE-3 in  the presence of IL-2 and IL-7. After a resting period of 2  wk, the responder cells of each microculture were tested  on day 35 for TNF or, more often, for IFN-&#x003b3; production  after stimulation for 20 h with autologous EBV-B cells  loaded with protein MAGE-3. </p><sec disp-level="4"><title>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T Cell Clones Directed against a MAGE-3 Antigen.</title><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells of hemochromatosis patient LB 1555, stimulated with dendritic cells loaded with protein MAGE-3,  were tested for their ability to produce TNF upon stimulation with EBV-B cells loaded with either protein MAGE-3  or OVA. It was possible to measure the production of TNF  by the T cells because, contrary to most EBV-B cell lines,  that of patient LB 1555 did not produce TNF. The microculture (B6 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) that produced the highest level of  TNF after stimulation with protein MAGE-3 was cloned  by limiting dilution using autologous EBV-B cells loaded  with protein MAGE-3 as stimulator cells. These stimulator  cells were used for the cloning step because of the limited  supply of autologous dendritic cells. A positive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  clone was obtained, referred to hereafter as clone 37. It recognized autologous EBV-B cells loaded with protein  MAGE-3. Even though the protein, which had been produced in bacteria, was &#x0003e;95% pure, we could not at this  stage exclude the possibility that clone 37 recognized a bacterial contaminant. Therefore, we prepared a set of peptides of 16 aa, which overlapped by 12 and covered the entire MAGE-3 protein sequence. Each of these peptides was  incubated with autologous EBV-B cells and tested for recognition by clone 37. We identified two overlapping peptides, MAGE-3<sub>111&#x02013;126</sub> and MAGE-3<sub>115&#x02013;130</sub> (see below), that  stimulated production of both TNF (data not shown) and  IFN-&#x003b3; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). This demonstrated unambiguously that  clone 37 recognized a MAGE-3 antigen and not a contaminant.  </p><p>A CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clone was obtained from another microculture  which was also very well stimulated by cells loaded with  protein MAGE-3 (F3 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, here the screening with the set of overlapping MAGE-3 peptides was negative. We found that the antigen recognized by this CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  clone was present in an HPLC fraction other than the one  containing the MAGE-3 protein (data not shown). Our  tentative conclusion is that this clone recognizes a bacterial  contaminant.</p><p>Additional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones were obtained from five independent microcultures, set up with cells from another  hemochromatosis patient. Their ability to recognize cells  loaded with protein MAGE-3 appeared to decrease upon  further purification of the protein by HPLC. Two of these  clones were also tested for their response to the set of  MAGE-3 peptides, with negative results, suggesting further  that they recognized a contaminant in the MAGE-3 batch.  Therefore, it appears that bacterial contaminants in this  MAGE-3 protein batch were more likely to activate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cells than was MAGE-3 itself, so that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones specific for MAGE-3 constituted only a minor fraction of the  clones obtained with this procedure.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Clone 37 Recognizes Peptide AELVHFLLLKYRAR on  HLA-DR13.</title><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clone 37 recognized two peptides  which overlapped by 12 aa, namely RKVAELVHFLLLKYRA (aa 111&#x02013;126) and ELVHFLLLKYRAREPV (aa  115&#x02013;130) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). The recognition by clone 37 of cells  loaded with protein MAGE-3 was abolished by an anti&#x02013; HLA-DR antibody (data not shown). Patient LB 1555 was  serologically typed DR3, DR13, and DR52. To identify  the presenting HLA-DR molecule, we tested additional  EBV-B cell lines expressing DR3, DR13, or DR52. All  and only those expressing DR13 were able to present the  MAGE-3<sub>111&#x02013;126</sub> and MAGE-3<sub>115&#x02013;130 </sub>peptides to clone 37  (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). 31 different HLA-DR13 alleles have been described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). LB 1555 expresses the DRB1*1302  allele, and the other DR13 cell lines tested express DRB1*  1301 or DRB1*1302, the latter two representing 80% of  the HLA-DR13 alleles. </p><p>Unlike the peptides presented by class I molecules, those  presented by class II usually vary in length and tolerate extensions at both the NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini because they  are not fixed by their ends in the groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, it  is difficult to define the length of those peptides precisely.  We tested a large number of MAGE-3 peptides of different  lengths (data not shown) and concluded that the shortest  peptide well recognized by clone 37 is AELVHFLLLKYRAR (aa 114&#x02013;127; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). Half-maximum value of  stimulation was obtained by incubating the stimulator cells  with 10 nM of this peptide. This compares favorably with  the results obtained with other epitopes recognized on  HLA class II molecules by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells: a minimum of 30  nM of a bcr-abl peptide was needed to induce a significant  proliferation of an anti&#x02013;bcr-abl CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cell line, whereas  330 nM of peptide p21-<italic>ras</italic> was required for anti&#x02013;p21-<italic>ras</italic>  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Dendritic Cells Incubated with Cell Lysates Present the  MAGE-3 Antigen.</title><p>We tested dendritic cells, incubated  with decreasing concentrations of MAGE-3 protein, for  their ability to stimulate clone 37 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). Half-maximum production of IFN-&#x003b3; was obtained when 10<sup>4</sup> dendritic cells were preincubated in a volume of 100 &#x003bc;l with  30 ng of the protein, which is approximately the amount  present in 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> MZ2-MEL.43 tumor cells (Godelaine,  D., personal communication). This suggested that a dendritic cell, having endocytosed debris of just one or a few  tumor cells expressing MAGE-3, would be capable of stimulating anti&#x02013;MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. To test further the  ability of dendritic cells to process debris of cells expressing  MAGE-3, 293-EBNA cells transiently transfected with the  <italic>MAGE-3</italic> gene were lysed and incubated for 24 h with  HLA-DR13 dendritic cells. These cells stimulated clone 37  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B).

MAGE-3 Construct.</title><p>A melanoma cell line which expresses HLA-DR13 and MAGE-3 was unable to stimulate  the release of IFN-&#x003b3; by clone 37, unless it was pulsed with  the MAGE-3<sub>115&#x02013;130 </sub>peptide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). This suggests that the  MAGE-3 protein synthesized endogenously does not reach  the class II presentation pathway. It has been reported that  signals within the Ii could be used to target endogenously  synthesized protein to the class II antigen-processing compartments. The expression of several constructs, which encoded fusion proteins containing part of the mouse Ii followed by fragments of the OVA gene, generated OVA  peptides recognized by murine CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells on MHC  class II molecules. The highest level of antigen presentation  was obtained with a construct containing the sequence  coding for the first 80 amino acids of the Ii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Accordingly, MZ2-MEL.43 cells were transduced with a retroviral  construct encoding the first 80 amino acids of the human Ii  fused with MAGE-3 (retro&#x02013;Ii.MAGE-3). MZ2-MEL.43  cells transduced with retro&#x02013;Ii.MAGE-3 stimulated a high  production of IFN-&#x003b3; by clone 37, indicating that the  Ii.MAGE-3 protein was processed through the class II presentation pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). HLA-DR13 EBV-B cells transduced with the same construct also stimulated clone 37 (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B).

After three restimulations, one microculture produced IFN-&#x003b3;  upon stimulation with autologous EBV-B cells loaded with  the protein. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clone 2 was isolated, which produced  IFN-&#x003b3; upon stimulation with cells that were either loaded  with MAGE-3 protein or transduced with Ii.MAGE-3, the  latter proving that the clone was directed against MAGE-3  and not against a contaminant of the protein batch (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). </p><p>When the set of overlapping MAGE-3 peptides were  tested for recognition by clone 2, peptide ELVHFLLLKYRAREPV (aa 115&#x02013;130) scored positive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B).  This peptide was shown previously to be recognized by  clone 37, isolated from hemochromatosis patient LB 1555.  However, peptide FLLLKYRAREPVTKAE (aa 119&#x02013;134)  scored positive with clone 2 but was not recognized by  clone 37 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B). Moreover, peptide RKVAELVHFLLLKYRA (aa 111&#x02013;126), previously shown to be recognized  by clone 37, was not recognized by clone 2. This indicated  clearly that clones 2 and 37 were directed against two adjacent but distinct epitopes. Several EBV-B cell lines were  tested for their ability to present peptide MAGE-3<sub>119&#x02013;134</sub> to  clone 2. All and only those expressing DR13 were capable  of presenting the peptide (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). Patient 7002 expresses  the DRB1*1302 allele. We tested a large number of  MAGE-3 peptides at different concentrations to identify  the shortest peptide efficiently recognized by clone 2 (data  not shown).

We are quite confident that it will prove to be applicable to other proteins for the identification of new antigens presented by HLA class II molecules. But our approach is not without disadvantages: a large number of the  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones obtained were apparently directed against  contaminants of the protein batch. Therefore, it will be  preferable to use one source of antigen for stimulation of  the T cells and another to test their specificity. This may be  achieved using two batches of protein produced in different organisms, such as bacteria and insect cells infected with  baculovirus constructs, or, as shown here, by the use of  presenting cells expressing the protein of interest fused to a  truncated Ii.</p><p>Antigens can be processed through two different pathways  that lead to presentation on HLA class II molecules. The endogenous pathway channels some proteins synthesized in the  cell towards endosomal compartments, where they are  cleaved into peptides that then associate with class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). In the exogenous pathway, the APC takes up  protein by endocytosis. Early endosomes undergo a progressive transition to late endosomes and then to lysosomes. The  late endosomes have a relatively low pH, contain lysosomal  hydrolases, and are enriched in HLA-DM and MHC class II  molecules, which are associated with Ii in nonameric complexes. Therefore, they are also called MHC class II compartments (MIIC). Ii is rapidly degraded but class II&#x02013;associated Ii peptide (CLIP), a small part of it, remains bound  within the groove of the MHC molecule and blocks access  of other peptides until HLA-DM catalyzes its dissociation  from class II molecules. This permits the subsequent loading  of potentially antigenic peptides. The peptide&#x02013;HLA class II  complexes are then directed to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Melanocyte-specific proteins such as tyrosinase contain a  lysosomal targeting sequence that enables them to follow  the endogenous class II processing pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Therefore, these differentiation antigens can be recognized directly by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells on those melanomas that express  class II molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Constitutive expression of class II  occurs frequently in melanoma. In line with their cytosolic  and nuclear localizations, the MAGE proteins appear to  lack the targeting sequences that would enable them to follow the endogenous class II pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). This  probably explains why the anti&#x02013;MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones  obtained were unable to recognize an HLA-DR13 tumor  cell line expressing MAGE-3.</p><p>The anti&#x02013;MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones could be stimulated by  HLA-DR13 dendritic cells loaded with extracts of cells  producing a large amount of MAGE-3 protein. However,  they failed to recognize dendritic cells incubated with lysates of tumor cells expressing <italic>MAGE-3</italic>. This might be  due to a lower quantity of protein MAGE-3 in these tumor  cell extracts. However, this process may be more efficient  in vivo, where loading of dendritic cells with apoptotic  bodies from tumor cells might result in very efficient presentation of MAGE-3 epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The notion that  MAGE-3 antigens can be presented to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in  vivo is supported by the observation that some cancer patients produce anti-MAGE antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). This is  probably due to destruction of some tumor cells followed  by uptake of the debris by macrophages or dendritic cells.</p><p>In a recently completed clinical trial, 25 tumor-bearing  HLA-A1 melanoma patients with advanced disease received 3 subcutaneous injections of a MAGE-3 peptide  presented by HLA-A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Tumor regressions were observed in seven patients, and three of these were complete.  No increase in anti-MAGE CTLs could be detected in the  blood of these patients, including those whose tumor regressed. The regressions occurred very slowly, suggesting  that they may have been caused by a weak immune response. A major limitation of such a class I peptide&#x02013;based  approach might be that the CTLs elicited by the peptide  reach the tumor but fail to be restimulated properly at the  tumor site so that CTL amplification does not occur. This  could be due to the lack of help by tumor-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells. Vaccination strategies with MAGE-3 products may  benefit from the induction of anti&#x02013;MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells,  despite the fact that tumor cells that express both class II  molecules and MAGE-3 are unable to activate CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells directly. Upon lysis of some tumor cells by a first CTL  attack, tumor debris could be processed by tumor-infiltrating APCs. Activated tumor-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells located  around the tumor could then be restimulated by these cells.  These CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes might then favor the activation and proliferation of the effector CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, provoke the maturation of dendritic cells via CD40&#x02013;CD40L  interactions, and mediate recruitment of additional immune cells at the tumor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). The resulting amplification of the immune response might then lead rapidly to  the complete destruction of the tumor mass. Immunization  with MAGE-3 peptides presented by class I and class II  molecules or with a purified protein may represent one  possibility for inducing both MAGE-3&#x02013;specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Another possibility is the reinfusion into patients of autologous APCs loaded with MAGE-3 peptides  binding to both HLA class I and class II molecules. This will  require the characterization of several epitopes to cope with  HLA restriction. Alternatively, autologous dendritic cells  could be infected with recombinant viruses encoding an  Ii.MAGE-3 fusion protein. Expression of Ii.MAGE-3 in  EBV-transformed B cells was shown to result not only in the  presentation of class II epitopes, but also in a very efficient  presentation of a class I epitope recognized by an anti&#x02013; MAGE-3.A1 CTL (Corthals, J., and K. Thielemans, manuscript in preparation). Patients could also be immunized directly with recombinant viruses encoding Ii.MAGE-3.</p><p>A number of results obtained in mice support the importance of immunization against antigens presented by class II  molecules. Direct injection of a recombinant vaccinia encoding a human papilloma virus E7 protein linked to the  sorting signal of the lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) was very effective in inducing protective  immunity against a challenge with an E7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor.  In contrast, animals injected with a vaccinia coding for the  normal E7 protein were not protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In another  mouse model, strong protection was achieved against  highly aggressive tumor cells lacking MHC class II expression through a single vaccination with a tumor-specific T  helper peptide encoded by the Moloney murine leukemia  virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In this model, the CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs were helped efficiently by peptide-primed tumor-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.</p><p>A clinical trial was recently initiated with a MAGE-3 recombinant protein. In this trial as in others involving recombinant viruses harboring large <italic>MAGE</italic> sequences, it  will be essential to have reliable monitoring of the anti&#x02013; MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> response. Our observations that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  cells directed against a minor contaminant in the protein  batch can easily be activated in vitro have implications for  this monitoring. To avoid possible misinterpretation of in  vitro assays and of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assays, a protein produced in another organism or autologous  cells expressing the antigen endogenously should be used  for these assays. Another possibility, which narrows the  analysis to certain epitopes, is the use of a set of relevant  peptides that can be used either to select and amplify peptide-specific T cells in vitro or to label directly T cell receptors with soluble HLA tetramers presenting the relevant  peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Multimeric soluble MHC class II molecules, complexed with a peptide attached covalently, were  recently shown to bind with appropriate specificity and affinity to mouse-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). This approach requires  prior identification of the antigenic peptides, as described  in this report. Considering that several <italic>MAGE</italic> genes share  the sequence coding for one of the two MAGE-3.DR13  epitopes reported here, these peptides are relevant to  &#x0223c;16% of Caucasian melanoma patients, as 20% of Caucasians express HLA-DR13 and &#x0223c;80% of metastatic melanomas express <italic>MAGE-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, <italic>-3</italic>, or -<italic>6</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the procedure used to obtain anti&#x02013;MAGE-3 CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM982183.f1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Production of TNF by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells stimulated with autologous EBV-B cells incubated with protein MAGE-3.
