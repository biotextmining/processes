Metabolic labeling experiments with radioactive serine, sphingosine, and choline showed that LY-A cells were  defective in synthesis of SM from these precursors, but  not syntheses of ceramide (Cer), glycosphingolipids, or  phosphatidylcholine, indicating a specific defect in the  conversion of Cer to SM in LY-A cells. In vitro experiments showed that the specific defect of SM formation  in LY-A cells was not due to alterations in enzymatic  activities responsible for SM synthesis or degradation.  When cells were treated with brefeldin A, which causes  fusion of the Golgi apparatus with the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER), de novo SM synthesis in LY-A cells  was restored to the wild-type level. Pulse&#x02013;chase experiments with a fluorescent Cer analogue, <italic>N</italic>-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-<italic>s</italic>-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-sphingosine (C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer), revealed  that in wild-type cells C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer was redistributed  from intracellular membranes to the Golgi apparatus in  an intracellular ATP-dependent manner, and that LY-A cells were defective in the energy-dependent redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer. Under ATP-depleted  conditions, conversion of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM  and of [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine to [<sup>3</sup>H]SM in wild-type cells decreased to the levels in LY-A cells, which were not affected by ATP depletion. ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored or  membrane-spanning proteins in LY-A cells appeared  to be normal. These results indicate that the predominant pathway of ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of  Cer for de novo SM synthesis is ATP dependent and  that this pathway is almost completely impaired in LY-A cells. In addition, the specific defect of SM synthesis in LY-A cells suggests different pathways of Cer  transport for glycosphingolipids versus SM synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sphingomyelin</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd><kwd>mutant</kwd><kwd>Chinese hamster ovary cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>L<sc>ipids</sc> serve not only as essential constituents of the  fluid matrix of biological membranes, but also as  modulators regulating various cellular events. Membrane lipids of mammalian cells consist mainly of three  different classes of lipids (glycerolipids, sterols, and sphingolipids), which are categorized according to the structure  of their hydrophobic backbones. In living cells, the membranes of different intracellular organelles have different  lipid compositions, and various biomembranes show an  asymmetric distribution of lipid types across the membrane bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Alberts et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, various  steps in lipid biosynthesis can occur in different intracellular compartments; for example, ceramide (Cer)<sup>1</sup> produced  in the ER is sorted to the Golgi apparatus for conversion  to sphingomyelin (SM) or glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hoekstra and Kok, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">van Meer, 1993</xref>). Phosphatidylserine produced  in the ER is sorted to the mitochondria where phosphatidylserine is converted to phosphatidylethanolamine,  which is translocated to the plasma membrane (reviewed  in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Trotter and Voelker, 1994</xref>). Thus, the synthesis, translocation, and sorting of lipids represent an important set of  problems relating to membrane biogenesis and homeostasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying lipid transport and sorting, although various pathways for intracellular transport of newly synthesized lipids  have been suggested (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Moreau and Cassagne,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Trotter and Voelker, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Sphingolipid biosynthesis is initiated by condensation  of <sc>l</sc>-serine with palmitoyl CoA, a reaction catalyzed by  serine palmitoyltransferase to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, which is then converted to dihydrosphingosine (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Merrill and Jones, 1990</xref> for review of sphingolipid biosynthesis). Dihydrosphingosine is <italic>N</italic>-acylated to  produce dihydroceramide (DCer), followed by desaturation to form Cer. These early synthetic steps occur at the  cytosolic surface of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Mandon et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hirschberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Michel and van Echten-Deckert, 1997</xref>).  Cer, a common intermediate for both SM and glycosphingolipid syntheses, is translocated from the ER to the Golgi  apparatus by yet-undefined mechanisms, and then converted to SM by the enzyme phosphatidylcholine:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase (SM synthase) in the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus or to GlcCer on the  cytosolic surface of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Coste et al., 1986</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Futerman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Futerman and Pagano, 1991</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Trinchera et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Jeckel et al., 1992</xref>). After translocation into the Golgi lumen, GlcCer is further converted to  lactosylceramide and more complex glycosphingolipids.  SM and glycosphingolipids produced in the Golgi lumen  are predominantly delivered to the plasma membrane,  most likely via the bulk flow of membranes from the Golgi  apparatus to the plasma membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hoekstra  and Kok, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">van Meer,  1993</xref>), while a portion of newly synthesized GlcCer reaches  the plasma membrane by a non-Golgi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Warnock  et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>A powerful approach towards understanding the metabolic mechanisms and biological functions of membrane  phospholipids is the biochemical and cell-biological characterization of cell mutants with specific defects in phospholipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Nishijima et al., 1997</xref>). Lysenin, derived from the coelomic fluid of the earthworm <italic>Eisenia  foetida</italic>, is a cytolysin that binds to SM with a high affinity  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Yamaji et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, we isolated several types  of lysenin-resistant CHO cell mutants, two of which (designated LY-A and LY-B strains) are defective in SM production, and the LY-B strain has been found to lack the  LCB1 subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hanada et al.,  1998</xref>). In this study, we further characterize the LY-A  strain and find that this mutant is defective in an ATP-dependent trafficking pathway of Cer from the ER to the  Golgi apparatus for de novo SM synthesis. As far as we  are aware, this study is the first report providing genetic  evidence for the existence of specific machinery for intracellular trafficking of Cer. We also discuss models for ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of de novo synthesized Cer  toward SM or glycosphingolipids.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p><italic>N</italic>-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-<italic>s</italic>-indacene-3-pentanoyl)- <sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro</italic>-sphingosine (C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer) and 6-[<italic>N</italic>-(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>erythro-</italic>sphingosine (C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer) were purchased from Molecular Probes.

Under conditions without brefeldin A, the rate of SM synthesis in LY-A  cells was only 10% of the wild-type level, while the labeling rates of other lipids in LY-A cells were comparable to  the wild-type levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast, under brefeldin  A&#x02013;treated conditions, the rate of SM synthesis in LY-A  cells was quite similar to the wild-type level, which was about  threefold higher than the rate in brefeldin A&#x02013;untreated  wild-type cells, while labeling rates of Cer, GlcCer, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine were also  similar between wild-type and LY-A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In addition, we used [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine and [<sup>3</sup>H]dihydrosphingosine  for monitoring the rate of Cer-to-SM conversion and  observed restoration of SM synthesis in LY-A cells to  the wild-type levels under brefeldin A&#x02013;treated conditions  (data not shown).

In addition, when cells prelabeled with  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer are warmed up to physiological temperatures, C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is efficiently accumulated into the  Golgi region and metabolized to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pagano  et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Ktistakis et al., 1995</xref>), indicating the possibility  that the ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking behavior of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer mimics that of natural Cer produced at the ER.</p><p>For testing whether the behavior of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer in  cells reflected the defect of SM synthesis in LY-A cells, the  metabolic rate of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM was compared between wild-type and LY-A cells. Cells were preincubated with C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C for transferring the probe to intracellular membranes and, after  washing the extracellular C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer, cells were incubated at 33&#x000b0;C for various times to start conversion of intracellular C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM. During the chase,  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer was metabolized to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in a time-dependent manner, resulting in conversion of 50% of the  total lipidic fluorescence to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in wild-type cells  30 min after the chase, while the metabolic rate of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in LY-A cells was about half of  the wild-type level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A).

After prelabeling of cells with  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer at 4&#x000b0;C, intracellular fluorescence was distributed throughout intracellular membranes including the  ER in both wild-type and LY-A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A and B).  After the chase at 33&#x000b0;C for 15&#x02013;30 min, most of the intracellular fluorescence in wild-type cells accumulated in the  perinuclear region corresponding to the Golgi complex  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, C and E), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pagano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Ktistakis et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, accumulation of intracellular fluorescence in the Golgi region  was lower in LY-A cells than wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, D and  F vs. C and E). The lower level of the Golgi fluorescence  in LY-A cells was not due to an enhanced secretion of intracellular DMB fluorescence to the medium, because  there was no significant difference in the total amount of  DMB lipids associated with cells between the two cell  types during the pulse and chase periods (data not shown).  These observations also provided evidence that LY-A  cells are defective in ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking  of Cer. </p></sec><sec><title>Energy Dependence of Redistribution of Intracellular  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi Apparatus</title><p>For examination of the energy dependence of intracellular  redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer, cells were pretreated with  or without energy inhibitors (50 mM 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose  and 5 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) for 15 min at 33&#x000b0;C, incubated with C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C, washed, and chased for 15  min at 33&#x000b0;C in the presence or absence of the energy inhibitors. Measurements of intracellular ATP showed that  wild-type and LY-A cells had the same ATP levels under  the inhibitor-minus control conditions, and ATP levels in  both cell types were reduced by &#x0003e;95% in the presence of  the inhibitors. ATP depletion did not affect the level and  distribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer during the prelabeling of cells  at 4&#x000b0;C; DMB fluorescence was distributed to various intracellular membranes (data not shown), as seen under the  normal conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A and B). However, after the  chase at 33&#x000b0;C, the level of DMB fluorescence accumulated  into the Golgi region in wild-type cells was strikingly lower  under the ATP-depleted conditions than under the control  conditions, while in LY-A cells ATP depletion did not appreciably affect the Golgi level of DMB fluorescence (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A&#x02013;D). Consequently, ATP depletion reduced the DMB  fluorescence level associated with the Golgi apparatus in  wild-type cells to the level of LY-A cells. </p><p>Biochemical analysis showed that the ATP-depleted  conditions caused an &#x0223c;50% reduction of the conversion  rate of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in wild-type cells  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), indicating that the ATP-dependent redistribution  of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is responsible for synthesis of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in wild-type cells. The reduced rate in wild-type cells  was almost identical to the rate in LY-A cells, which was  not affected by ATP depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), being consistent  with the similar level of DMB fluorescence in Golgi apparatus between ATP-depleted wild-type and normally cultured LY-A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, B and C). There was no difference in the total amount of lipidic DMB fluorescence  associated with cells between the normal and ATP-depleted  cells even after the 33&#x000b0;C chase (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicated that, in wild-type cells, redistribution of intracellular C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi  apparatus for C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM synthesis consists of an ATP-dependent pathway(s) and an ATP-independent (or less  ATP-dependent) pathway(s), and that the ATP-dependent trafficking pathway of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is almost completely impaired in LY-A cells. </p></sec><sec><title>Metabolism and Intracellular Behavior of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer  in Cells</title><p>While C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is a poor substrate for GlcCer synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pagano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Paul et al., 1996</xref>), C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer,  another fluorescent analogue of Cer, serves as an efficient  substrate for both GlcCer and SM syntheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Futerman  and Pagano, 1991</xref>).

During the chase, C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer was converted to C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-SM or C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-GlcCer in a time-dependent manner with redistribution of NBD fluorescence to  the Golgi apparatus, in agreement with a previous study  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lipsky and Pagano, 1983</xref>). In contrast to the cases with  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A&#x02013;D, and 9 A), redistribution of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to the Golgi region or conversion of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-SM was not affected by ATP depletion  even in wild-type cells, and C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer behaved almost  identically between LY-A and wild-type cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>,  E&#x02013;H, and 9 B). The conversion rate of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-GlcCer under the ATP-depletion conditions was  &#x0223c;70&#x02013;75% of the normal level, probably due to a decrease  in the intracellular UDP-glucose level by ATP depletion.  These results indicated that C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer is efficiently redistributed to the Golgi apparatus not via the ATP-dependent pathway, which is involved in the redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi apparatus. However, this nature of  C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer allowed us to demonstrate that the ATP-depleted conditions used did not cause an inhibition of SM  synthase activity itself or extensive destruction of the  Golgi apparatus.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of ATP Depletion on SM and GlcCer Formation  from [<sup>3</sup>H]Sphingosine</title><p>We next examined the effect of ATP depletion on conversion of natural Cer to SM by metabolic labeling with  [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine. ATP depletion of wild-type cells resulted  in the reduction of the [<sup>3</sup>H]SM formation to the level of  LY-A cells, which was not affected by ATP depletion (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), being consistent with the results of the pulse&#x02013;chase  experiments using C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A). Although the  [<sup>3</sup>H]SM formation in wild-type cells under the ATP-depleted conditions was only 30% of the normal level, the  [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcCer formation under the ATP-depleted conditions  was &#x0223c;65% of the normal level both in wild-type and LY-A  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Considering that GlcCer formation appeared to be partially inhibited by a reduction of the  UDP-glucose level under the ATP-depletion conditions,  effects of ATP depletion on accessibility of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer to SM  and GlcCer synthases could be estimated by the corrected  values of [<sup>3</sup>H]SM/C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-SM and [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcCer/C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-GlcCer, respectively, although we did not eliminate the  possibility that access of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to SM and GlcCer  synthases was not completely ATP independent. The corrected values suggested that the influence of ATP depletion on [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer trafficking caused &#x0223c;70% and &#x0223c;20% inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]SM and [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcCer formation, respectively  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, bottom). ATP depletion did not reduce the level  of [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine associated with cells and did cause an  increase in the level of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer along with the striking decrease in [<sup>3</sup>H]SM, ruling out the possibility that the decreased formation of [<sup>3</sup>H]SM under the ATP-depleted  conditions was due to a decrease in cellular uptake of  [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine or formation of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer from [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine. These results demonstrated evidence that trafficking of natural Cer from the ER to the site for SM synthesis  is mainly ATP dependent and that this ATP-dependent  trafficking of Cer is defective in LY-A cells. </p></sec><sec><title>ER-to-Golgi Apparatus Trafficking of GPI-anchored  and Membrane-spanning Glycoproteins in LY-A Cells</title><p>To address the question of whether ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of proteins was affected in LY-A cells, we  determined the acquisition rate of Endo H resistance, a  well-accepted determinant for arrival in the medial Golgi  apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985</xref>). For this, we  used wild-type and LY-A cells constitutively expressing  GPI-anchored alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) or chimeric  alkaline phosphatase (PLAP-HA) having a membrane-spanning region in place of the GPI anchor. PLAP and  PLAP-HA in these cells were pulse-labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased for various time at  33&#x000b0;C. Then, extracts from the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLAP antibody, treated with Endo H,  and separated by SDS-PAGE for detection of the Endo  H&#x02013;sensitive and &#x02013;resistant forms.

In this  study, we attempted to identify a defective step causing  the phenotype of LY-A cells.</p><p>Metabolic labeling experiments with [<sup>14</sup>C]serine, [<sup>3</sup>H]  sphingosine, and [<sup>14</sup>C]choline indicated that conversion of  Cer to SM was impaired in LY-A cells, but that the formations of Cer and phosphatidylcholine, both of which are  immediate precursors for SM formation, are normal (Figs.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, enzyme assays in cell lysates showed no  difference in the activities of SM synthase, neutral sphingomyelinase, or acid sphingomyelinase between LY-A  and wild-type cells. Although reduced SM synthesis along  with Cer accumulation was observed during the mitotic  phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Yokoyama et al., 1997</xref>), LY-A and  wild-type cells grown in Nutridoma medium displayed virtually identical patterns of the phase distribution of the  cell cycle; 30&#x02013;32% of the total population of each cell type  was in the G1 phase, 50&#x02013;54% in the S phase, and 15&#x02013;17%  in the G2 plus M phases (data not shown). These in vivo  and in vitro experiments suggested that the defect of SM  formation in LY-A cells was not due to alterations in enzymatic activities responsible for SM metabolism nor to a  secondary effect of cell-cycle phase on the lipid metabolism, leading us to the possibility that LY-A cells had a defect in translocation of Cer from the ER to the Golgi compartment where SM synthase exists.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First,  when cells were treated with brefeldin A, SM synthesis  in LY-A cells was restored to the wild-type level (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), in agreement with the expectation that in brefeldin  A&#x02013;treated cells Cer is accessible to the normally Golgi apparatus&#x02013;localized SM synthase without the ER-to-Golgi  apparatus trafficking process. Second, pulse&#x02013;chase experiments with C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer in intact cells demonstrated that  redistribution of intracellular DMB fluorescence from intracellular membranes to the Golgi apparatus is strikingly  slower in LY-A cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), along  with the defect of conversion of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM in intact LY-A cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). Furthermore, ATP  depletion in wild-type cells inhibited the conversion of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM by 50% and also inhibited  redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi apparatus,  whereas ATP depletion did not affect the behavior of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer in LY-A cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, A&#x02013;D, and 9 A). Although  conversion of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to the SM metabolite may be  necessary for trapping NBD fluorescence in the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">P&#x000fc;tz and Schwarzmann, 1995</xref>), at least a portion  of the Golgi apparatus&#x02013;accumulated DMB fluorescence in  wild-type cells appears to be attributable to unconverted  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer, because the amount of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM formed  in LY-A cells after a 30-min chase was equivalent to that  of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM formed in wild-type cells after a 15-min  chase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A), whereas DMB fluorescence in the Golgi  region was much denser in the latter cells than in the  former (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, C and F). By contrast, intracellular labeling  with C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer, which rapidly transfers between membranes, displayed no difference in the Golgi redistribution  between LY-A and wild-type cells, or between normally  cultured and ATP-depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, E&#x02013;H). Thus, the  impairment of the Golgi accumulation of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer in  LY-A cells reflects a defect in the energy-dependent transport of this probe from intracellular membranes to the  Golgi apparatus. In addition, the findings that intracellular  DMB fluorescence is initially distributed throughout intracellular membranes after prelabeling with C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer at  4&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A and B; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Pagano et al., 1991</xref>) and that  &#x0003e;50% of the surface area of intracellular membranes is attributed to the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Griffiths et al., 1989</xref>) indicate that the energy-dependent redistribution of DMB  fluorescence most likely represents an ER-to-Golgi apparatus transport of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer. Importantly, this energy-dependent trafficking of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is relevant to  physiological trafficking of natural Cer for SM synthesis,  because ATP depletion in wild-type cells inhibited [<sup>3</sup>H]SM  formation from metabolically labeled [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer, whereas  [<sup>3</sup>H]SM formation in LY-A cells was not affected by ATP  depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that LY-A  cells are defective in ATP-dependent trafficking of Cer  from the ER to the Golgi compartment where SM synthase exists.</p><p>The defect in LY-A cells appears to be specific to Cer  transport. When cellular lipids were metabolically labeled  with [<sup>14</sup>C]serine, the formation rates of [<sup>14</sup>C]phosphatidylserine and [<sup>14</sup>C]phosphatidylethanolamine were identical between LY-A and wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), indicating  that transport of phosphatidylserine from the ER to the  mitochondria proceeds normally in LY-A cells. Cholesterol metabolism in LY-A cells is also suggested to be normal, since the amount of free cholesterol in LY-A cells is  the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Hanada et al., 1998</xref>). There was no appreciable difference in the acquisition rate of Endo H resistance of a membrane-spanning or a GPI-anchored protein between LY-A and wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>), indicating  that ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of proteins is not  defective in LY-A cells. Both wild-type and LY-A cells  display a similar preferential distribution of SM at the  plasma membrane (data not shown), suggesting that, once  SM is produced in the Golgi apparatus, SM is subsequently sorted to the plasma membrane in LY-A cells similar to wild-type cells.</p><p>Our findings that in wild-type CHO cells ATP depletion  inhibits conversion of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM by  50% concomitantly with inhibition of redistribution of intracellular DMB fluorescence to the Golgi apparatus (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>  and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A) suggest that a &#x0223c;50% portion of ER-to-Golgi  apparatus transfer of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is mediated via the  ATP-dependent pathway and that another 50% of the C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer transfer is mediated by ATP-independent (or  less ATP-dependent) mechanisms. The ATP-independent  redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi apparatus may  be at least partly attributable to a nonphysiological spontaneous transfer of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer between membranes due  to less hydrophobicity of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer than natural Cer.  For natural Cer, ATP-dependent and -independent (or  less ATP-dependent) trafficking mechanisms were estimated to be responsible for 70&#x02013;80% and 20&#x02013;30%, respectively, of newly synthesized SM, since ATP depletion  caused a 70&#x02013;80% inhibition of formation of [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine-derived SM without reduction of [<sup>3</sup>H]Cer formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). In contrast, redistribution of intracellular  C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to the Golgi apparatus or conversion of C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer to C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-SM was not, or only slightly, affected by ATP depletion. The different trafficking behavior between C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer and C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer most likely  reflects the fact that C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer has a much faster rate of  spontaneous transfer between artificial membranes than  C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bai and Pagano, 1997</xref>), implying that C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer is embedded in  membranes more firmly and thus mimics natural Cer more  accurately, compared with C<sub>6</sub>-NBD-Cer.</p></sec><sec><title>Different Pathways of Cer Transport for SM versus  GlcCer Synthesis</title><p>It has been postulated that a yet-undefined pathway(s)  mediates Cer trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and that, after arrival at the cytoplasmic surface of the  Golgi apparatus, Cer molecules are used for GlcCer synthesis and the residual Cer molecules are subsequently  used for SM synthesis after translocation to the lumenal  side of the Golgi apparatus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hoekstra and  Kok, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rosenwald and Pagano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">van Echten and  Sandhoff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">van Meer, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Collins and Warren  (1992)</xref> have shown that newly synthesized Cer can be delivered to the sites of SM and GlcCer synthases by a different pathway from the major vesicular-mediated trafficking  pathway for newly synthesized proteins during the mitotic  phase in HeLa cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Slomiany et al. (1992)</xref> have demonstrated that Cer-containing vesicles derived from the ER  fuse with the Golgi membrane in an <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide&#x02013; sensitive manner under cell-free conditions. On the other  hand, studies with another cell-free system and with a  semi-intact cell system to assay for the transfer of Cer between the ER and the Golgi membranes have suggested  that Cer could be transferred from the ER to the Golgi apparatus through a nonvesicular pathway in ATP-independent and <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide&#x02013;insensitive manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Moreau  et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kok et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>If ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of Cer is mediated  by only one pathway, it would be a paradox that LY-A  cells synthesize GlcCer to the wild-type level or more, in  spite of the defect of the ATP-dependent ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking of Cer. A possible explanation for the  paradoxical phenotype of LY-A cells is that the putative  sole pathway for ER-to-Golgi apparatus Cer trafficking  might be narrowed in LY-A cells, but that the narrowed  pathway might still supply enough Cer to produce a normal level of GlcCer in the Golgi apparatus, but not of SM.  However, this explanation is not consistent with the observation that formations of [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcCer and [<sup>3</sup>H]G<sub>M3</sub> from  [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine were somewhat higher in LY-A cells than  in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It is unlikely that the reduced  synthesis of SM results from an overconsumption of newly  synthesized Cer at the GlcCer synthesis step, since the  level of [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine-derived Cer was higher in LY-A  cells than in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and there was no difference in GlcCer synthase activity between the two cell  types (data not shown). Another possibility is that a transbilayer transport of Cer across the Golgi membranes is impaired in LY-A cells. However, the observation that SM  synthesis in LY-A cells was restored to the wild-type level  after brefeldin A treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) favors the interpretation that the phenotype of LY-A cells is primarily due to a  defect in the interorganelle transport of Cer, although we  cannot completely exclude the possibility that brefeldin A  treatment facilitates a transbilayer transport of Cer across  the membrane where SM synthase exists, thereby restoring SM synthesis to LY-A cells. Considering that SM synthase as well as ganglioside synthases are suggested to  exist more distally in the Golgi complex than GlcCer synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Futerman and Pagano, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Jeckel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">van  Echten and Sandhoff, 1993</xref>), an intra&#x02013;Golgi apparatus  transport of Cer might be specifically blocked in LY-A  cells. If so, one could expect accumulation of Cer in a pre-  or early Golgi region. However, there was no sign of such  specific redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer in LY-A cells (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), although this observation does not conflict with the alternative expectation that a block of the intra&#x02013;Golgi apparatus transport of Cer causes recycling of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to  the ER instead of its accumulation in the early Golgi apparatus. Note that LY-A cells normally produce G<sub>M3</sub> (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), eliminating the possibility that intra&#x02013;Golgi apparatus  transport pathways of various sphingolipid types are nonspecifically blocked in LY-A cells.</p><p>Therefore, we considered another possible mechanism  that Cer, produced at the ER, is accessible to GlcCer synthase by different pathways from the ATP-dependent trafficking pathway which is impaired in LY-A cells. This  mechanism appears to be consistent with the characteristics of LY-A cells; for example, the overflow of Cer to glycosphingolipids in LY-A cells could be mediated by the  putative pathway responsible for GlcCer synthesis. The  observation that an ATP depletion of wild-type cells  caused &#x0223c;70% inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]sphingosine-derived [<sup>3</sup>H]SM  formation, but only &#x0223c;20% inhibition of [<sup>3</sup>H]GlcCer formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>), may also be accounted for by the notion  that Cer is efficiently accessible to GlcCer synthase by  ATP-independent (or less ATP-dependent) trafficking, although there could be the alternative explanation that a  minor population of GlcCer synthase is distributed to the  ER in CHO cells, so that Cer produced at the ER is accessible to the ER-distributed GlcCer synthase without an interorganelle transport. Collectively, we propose that there  are at least two pathways for Cer trafficking from the ER  to the site of de novo SM synthesis: the ATP-dependent  major pathway, which is impaired in LY-A cells, and the  ATP-independent (or less ATP-dependent) minor pathway(s). This scenario appears to occur in various types of  mammalian cells since depletion of intracellular ATP in  HeLa cells and human skin fibroblasts affected redistribution of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to the Golgi apparatus and conversion of C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-Cer to C<sub>5</sub>-DMB-SM (data not shown), as  observed in wild-type CHO cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A).</p><p>Two hypothetical models may be conceivable to explain  the preferential delivery of Cer to SM synthase by the  ATP-dependent mechanism. In one model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> A), a  portion of newly synthesized Cer molecules is rapidly internalized to the lumenal side of the ER, and the lumenal  Cer is delivered to the Golgi apparatus via an ATP-dependent and vesicle-mediated pathway for SM synthesis, while  Cer remaining at the cytosolic side of the ER is delivered  to the cytosolic side of the Golgi apparatus via an ATP-independent (or less ATP-dependent) pathway for GlcCer  synthesis. In another model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> B), regardless of the  Cer topology in the ER membrane, a portion of the Cer  molecules enters an ATP-dependent pathway, which is  specifically directed to the Golgi subcompartment where  SM synthase is localized, while Cer molecules associated  with an ATP-independent (or less ATP-dependent) pathway have a broader specificity for their destination and are  eventually accessible to both GlcCer and SM synthases. If  LY-A cells have a deficiency in an intra&#x02013;Golgi apparatus  transport of Cer, it may be conceivable that the ATP-dependent step for specific delivery to the SM synthase&#x02013; localizing compartment is located at the intra&#x02013;Golgi apparatus transport of Cer. </p><p>Membrane proteins are delivered from the ER to the  Golgi apparatus by vesicular transport mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Rothman and Orci, 1990</xref>), and the same mechanisms for protein trafficking may be involved in the ATP-dependent  trafficking of Cer. However, since LY-A cells exhibit no  appreciable defect in ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking  of proteins, we currently speculate that the machine defective in LY-A cells could be a specific device for Cer  transport. There might be multiple, independent vesicular  transport pathways from the ER to the Golgi apparatus,  one of which is exclusive for Cer. For further elucidation  of the molecular mechanism underlying the intracellular  trafficking of Cer, additional studies, including identification of the genes related to this function, will be necessary,  and the LY-A strain will be a useful tool for this purpose  as well.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Metabolic labeling of lipids with [<sup>14</sup>C]serine in wild-type and LY-A cells.
