Histologic examination misses micrometastases in up to 20% of lymph nodes evaluated. In addition, non-invasive imaging modalities are not sensitive enough to detect small lymph nodes metastases. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of messenger RNA (mRNA) for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to increase the detection of micrometastases in lymph nodes from patients with esophageal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>RT-PCR of CEA mRNA was performed in lymph nodes from patients with malignant and benign esophageal disease. Each specimen was examined histopathologically and by RT-PCR and the results were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Metastases were present in 29 of 60 (48%) lymph nodes sample by minimally invasive staging from 13 patients with esophageal cancer when examined histopathologically. RT-PCR identified nodal metastases in 46 of these 60 (77%) samples. RT-PCR detected CEA mRNA in all 29 histologically positive samples and in 17 histologically negative lymph nodes. All lymph nodes from patients with benign disease (n=15) were negative both histopathologically and by RT-PCR. The stage of two patients was reclassified based on the RT-PCR results, which identified lymph node spread undetected histopathologically. Both of these patients developed recurrent disease after resection of the primary tumor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RT-PCR is more sensitive than histologic examination in the detection of lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer and can lead to diagnosis of a more advanced stage in some patients. The combination of minimally invasive surgical techniques in combination with new molecular diagnostic techniques may improve our ability to stage cancer patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>Esophageal cancer</kwd><kwd>Lymph node metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is rising at an alarming rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> The prognosis is poor, with a five year survival of 5-10%.

The nested PCR was performed in two successive steps. Step 1 was performed in a 20 &#x003bc;l reaction volume containing 1X PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), 250 &#x003bc;M dNTPs, 1 &#x003bc;M each primers A and B, and 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Twenty rounds of amplification were performed in a thermocycler (DNA Thermocycler 480, Perkin Elmer) under the following cycling conditions: 95&#x000b0; C (1 min) denaturation, 72&#x000b0; C (1 min) annealing, 72&#x000b0; C (1 min) extension, followed by a final extension of 72&#x000b0; C (10 min). Two ul of the Step 1 reaction product was transferred to another tube containing primers B and C, PCR buffer, dNTPs, and Taq DNA polymerase in the same concentrations as in Step 1. Step 2 was also performed in a 20 &#x003bc;l reaction volume. The second PCR reaction was performed under the same conditions as Step 1. Step 1 yields a 160-bp PCR product; the second PCR reaction produces a 131-bp product.</p><p>As a positive control for RNA quality, a PCR assay for aactin was performed for each sample.

As a control, 10 lymph nodes were obtained from 6 patients undergoing treatment of a benign esophageal disease, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or achalasia. Five lymph nodes were evaluated from a patient with a history of long-standing reflux and Barrett's metaplasia. In addition to lymph nodes, 8 samples of esophageal carcinoma (7 adenocarcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma), and 5 samples of normal esophagus were studied.</p><p>Each sample was carefully dissected from perinodal fat and soft tissue and then sectioned into two pieces.

This approach of grouping patients based only on the presence or absence of distant metastases without consideration of the extent of locoregional disease also limits evaluation of survival data on a stage by stage basis. Since a number of reports have shown that not only the presence of lymph node metastases but their number and location are important indicators of long-term survival, it is possible that a more accurate assessment of stage prior to treatment would allow a more thorough evaluation of efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup></p><p>Conventional imaging modalities employed to assess lymph node and distant metastases are inaccurate in over 40% of patients when compared to minimally invasive surgical staging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> Positron emission tomography offers a significant improvement over computerized tomography in detecting distant metastatic disease but is only 45% sensitive in detecting metastases lymph nodes under 1 cm in diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> Endoscopic ultrasound is accurate in assessment of the depth of tumor invasion but its utility in detecting small lymph node metastases has been questioned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Currently, the most accurate method to stage patients with esophageal cancer is by minimally invasive surgical biopsy. However, this approach is associated with a small but measurable morbidity, significant expense and requires an extensive surgical dissection to avoid sampling errors and under staging. Once lymph nodes are surgically biopsied, further errors may take place in the histologic evaluation since up to 20% of histologically negative lymph nodes are positive on re-examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> Immunohistochemical staining of lymph nodes to detect tumor markers may result in a higher detection rate of micrometastases when compared to histological examination but this technique is time consuming and labor intensive, and is not in widespread clinical use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Sensitive molecular methods, such as RT-PCR, have recently been employed to detect lymph node metastases in a variety of malignancies such as malignant melanoma, breast, colorectal, gastric, and esophageal carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> This method is designed to detect markers expressed in the carcinoma cells but not in normal lymph nodes. A CEA specific RT-PCR assay has been developed to detect carcinoma cells in bone marrow samples from patients with colorectal, pancreatic, or gastric carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup> Recently, this method has been modified to detect lymph nodes metastases in patients with esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> This preliminary report included a small number of patients with esophageal cancer.</p><p>Our preliminary experience with RT-PCR to detect the mRNA for CEA confirms that this technique has the potential to improve the accuracy of detecting lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer compared to histologic evaluation. As expected, CEA was present in all samples of esophageal carcinoma and normal esophagus and thus appears to be a marker specific for epithelial cells. Importantly, CEA was not present in any of the lymph nodes from patients without cancer. Thus in the absence of cancer there is no migration of epithelial cells from the esophagus to the lymph nodes. Histologic assessment of lymph nodes from patients with esophageal cancer detected 29 of 60 lymph nodes involved with metastatic disease. All histologically positive lymph nodes were positive by RT-PCR for CEA, indicating that there were no false negative results using this method. The number of positive lymph nodes increased to 49 of 60 when RT-PCR technology was applied. Two of three patients with histologically negative lymph nodes were determined to have nodal disease by RT-PCR staging. In nine of the 13 patients with esophageal cancer, the number of positive lymph nodes detected was increased by RT-PCR compared to histology.</p><p>CEA-specific RT-PCR is an extremely sensitive technique that facilitates the detection of histologically occult lymph node metastases in patients with esophageal cancer. The technique has the potential to improve upon the accuracy of current staging, aid in the evaluation of response to treatment, and impact on clinical decision making in patients with esophageal cancer. Further studies with clinical follow-up will be required to evaluate the role of RT-PCR in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with esophageal cancer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Source of financial support: American Cancer Society Medical Student Research Grant.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
