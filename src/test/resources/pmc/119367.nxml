In this context, I am proud to introduce <italic>Molecular Cancer </italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com"/>, a new forum for cutting-edge findings in cancer research.</p><p>This open access, online journal is interested in a wide range of manuscripts presenting original research and commentary. For original research, the common thread is that the work should reveal novel concepts of broad importance to the scientific community. <italic>Molecular Cancer</italic> publishes Reviews, Original research, Case reports, Short communications and Hypotheses.</p><p>Reviews are invited and should be of public interest. The common thread of Original research and Case reports is that they reveal novel concepts of wide importance and interest to the scientific community, with conclusions that deliver a substantial advance in understanding of an important problem. Short communications are preliminary results of exceptional interest that are particularly topical and relevant, and for which fast publication is essential. Hypotheses are ideas or critics of ideas with discussion that will deliver a substantial advance in the understanding of an important problem.</p><p>I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Rostock, Germany, for my work on mechanotransduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. From my collaborations with scientists at biotech companies and with clinicians, I came to recognise the need for a dynamic forum that fosters the exchange of ideas across the entire cancer community. We now have an opportunity to make <italic>Molecular Cancer</italic> just such a journal, and this is an exciting challenge. Assisting me in this new venture are Guido M. Sclabas, as Deputy Editor, and R. Scott Heller as Associate Editor. Guido has a background in surgical oncology and growth factor signalling. Scott's research focuses on Wnt signalling and pancreas development.</p><p>For <italic>Molecular Cancer</italic> to become an exciting forum for cancer research, we need you to contribute your most innovative and significant work in the cancer field. In exchange, <italic>Molecular Cancer</italic> will strive to provide a fast, fair, and constructive review process; the highest quality production values; and a dedicated team of professional scientific editors, who are willing to discuss your research, respond to your presubmission inquiries, and ensure that all manuscripts are reviewed on the basis of scientific merit and held to the highest standards of excellence and editorial consistency.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge our Editorial Board <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molecular-cancer.com/edboard/"/> for their commitment to the journal and to express my most sincere gratitude to the entire staff of BioMed Central <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/"/> for their valuable advice and support in launching this journal.</p><p>I invite you to work together with us to develop this new forum for cancer research, and I look forward to meeting you at conferences throughout the year.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pommerenke</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x000fc;rr</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Nebe</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rychly</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mechanical stressing of integrin receptors induces enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletally anchored proteins.</article-title><source>J Biol Chem</source><year>1998</year><volume>273</volume><fpage>5081</fpage><lpage>5085</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9478959</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1074/jbc.273.9.5081</pub-id></citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
