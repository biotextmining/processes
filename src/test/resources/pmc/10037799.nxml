Both during normal tissue homeostasis and particularly after tissue injury, HA is  mobilized from these sites through lymphatic vessels to  the lymph nodes where it is degraded before entering  the circulation for rapid uptake by the liver. Currently,  however, the identities of HA binding molecules which  control this pathway are unknown. Here we describe  the first such molecule, LYVE-1, which we have identified as a major receptor for HA on the lymph vessel  wall. The deduced amino acid sequence of LYVE-1  predicts a 322-residue type I integral membrane  polypeptide 41% similar to the CD44 HA receptor with  a 212-residue extracellular domain containing a single  Link module the prototypic HA binding domain of the  Link protein superfamily. Like CD44, the LYVE-1  molecule binds both soluble and immobilized HA.  However, unlike CD44, the LYVE-1 molecule colocalizes with HA on the luminal face of the lymph vessel  wall and is completely absent from blood vessels.  Hence, LYVE-1 is the first lymph-specific HA receptor  to be characterized and is a uniquely powerful marker  for lymph vessels themselves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>endothelium, lymphatic</kwd><kwd>DNA, complementary</kwd><kwd>receptors, cell surface</kwd><kwd>recombinant fusion proteins</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>H<sc>yaluronan</sc> (HA),<sup>1</sup> a linear polymer of (1-&#x003b2;-4)  <sc>d</sc>-glucuronic acid (1-&#x003b2;-3) <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine,  is a large glycosaminoglycan found in the tissue  matrix and body fluids of all vertebrates which plays a fundamental role in regulating cell migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). This role is first apparent during development,  when changes in the levels of matrix HA induce condensation of mesenchymal cells and lead to the onset of chondrogenesis and myogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In later life,  HA facilitates cell migration in processes such as wound  healing and inflammation by forming a pericellular matrix  surrounding fibroblasts and epithelial cells, reducing the  level of intercellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The critical importance of HA in all of these roles is underlined by the observation that deletion of HA synthases in knockout mice  results in early death of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>).</p><p>The largest concentrations of HA are found within the  skin and musculo-skeletal system which account for &#x0003e;50%  of total body HA. Here the rate of HA turnover is rapid  (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> 0.5 d) by comparison with other extracellular matrix  components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Surprisingly, most degradation does not  occur within the skin itself; rather HA is transported  through the lymphatic system to distant lymph nodes  where &#x0003e;90% of the glycosaminoglycan in afferent lymph  is degraded or reenters the circulation to be rapidly endocytosed by liver endothelial HA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).  Hence, the lymphatic vessels are a major conduit for HA  transport from tissues such as the skin and intestine, where  flux measurements indicate they can remove as much as  10% of the total HA content within a 24-h period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).  This turnover can be further increased after either tissue  injury or sepsis. Yet why HA should require transport  through the lymphatics is not presently understood and little or nothing is known about the nature of any HA-binding molecules involved.</p><p>The majority of HA-binding proteins within the tissues  belong to the Link protein superfamily. Members of this  superfamily contain a conserved disulfide linked domain  of &#x0223c;100 amino acid residues termed the Link module,  which binds the minimal recognition unit HA<sub>6&#x02013;8</sub> and  whose three-dimensional structure resembles the sugar-binding domain of C-type lectins. Other superfamily members in addition to the Link protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) include the large  matrix proteoglycans Aggrecan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), Versican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), and  Brevican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), the tumor necrosis factor&#x02013;inducible protein  TSG-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and a single cell surface HA receptor, the  CD44 molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). CD44 is widely expressed on epithelial, mesenchymal, and lymphoid cells, where it is  thought to constitute the major receptor for HA (reviewed  in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Interactions between CD44 and HA are implicated  in several diverse functions including the maintenance of  tissue structure within the epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>), the extravasation  of lymphocytes through inflamed vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and the hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). The only other HA receptors characterized to  date are RHAMM (receptor for HA-mediated motility), a  58-kD intracellular protein expressed transiently on the  surface of transformed lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>), the cation-dependent liver endothelial cell (LEC) receptors responsible for the clearance of HA from the serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>), and  the nuclear protein cdc37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). To date, however, there is  no specific evidence that either CD44, RHAMM, or the  LEC HA receptors are involved in the sequestration or  transport of HA by lymphatic vessels, or in its uptake or  degradation within the lymph nodes. Indeed, deletion of  the CD44 gene in knockout mice produced no significant  abnormalities, and resulted in no significant disruption of  lymphatic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Hence the identities of HA receptors involved in lymphatic HA homeostasis are completely  unknown and we understand little about the regulation of  this important physiological process.</p><p>Here we present the first identification of an HA receptor that is almost exclusively expressed on lymph vessels  and is absent from blood vessels. This novel receptor  which we have named LYVE-1 is a homologue of the  CD44 HA receptor and a new member of the Link protein  superfamily. We present evidence that LYVE-1 sequesters  HA on lymph vessel endothelium in vivo and highlight the  significance of this novel receptor in further defining the  structure and function of the lymphatic system.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, Antibodies, Chemicals, and Ig Fusion Proteins</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were kindly donated  by Dr. Sue Adams (Molecular Parasitology Group, University of Oxford)  and used at the third passage. mAbs to human CD31 (JC70), CD34  (QBEND 10), and von Willebrand factor (vWF, F8/86) were kindly donated by Dr. David Mason (Department of Cellular Science, University of  Oxford).

A homology search of the combined Human Genome Sciences/TIGR EST databases with the  amino acid sequence of full-length CD44H using the  BLAST program identified a number of ESTs with predicted amino acid sequences &#x0003e;30% similar to CD44. 59  identical ESTs were identified in libraries prepared from  fetal tissues including liver, spleen, brain, and heart; adult  human placenta, bone marrow, lung, and spinal cord; glioblastoma, ovarian, and bone tumor; and HUVEC. The  2,313-bp EST from HUVEC which we have termed  LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial HA receptor) was  subjected to complete nucleotide sequencing. Translation  of the LYVE-1 cDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A) revealed a large (966 bp)  open reading frame starting with a Kozak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) consensus  ATG initiation codon at position 91 and terminating with  the TAG stop codon at position 1057. The deduced amino  acid sequence encodes a 322-residue polypeptide with the  features characteristic of a type I integral membrane glycoprotein. These are: a sequence of 26 largely hydrophobic residues at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus most likely comprising  the leader peptide; a hydrophilic sequence of 212 amino  acids containing seven cysteine residues, a serine/threonine-rich region (residues 145&#x02013;216) and two motifs for  N-linked glycosylation (NFT and NSS, centered on residues 54 and 131, respectively) corresponding to an extracellular domain; a sequence of 21 hydrophobic residues  immediately followed by the dibasic motif KR and a  highly charged stretch of 63 residues predicted to form the  transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail, respectively  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A). The predicted transmembrane anchor is also  apparent in Kyte-Doolittle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and Goldman hydropathy  plots of the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). The  position of the mature NH<sub>2</sub> terminus is predicted to be Ala  27 based on the &#x02212;3 &#x0002b;1 rule proposed by Von Heijne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>Similarities between the Link Modules in LYVE-1 and CD44</title><p>Alignment of the LYVE-1 amino acid sequence with that  of the human CD44 HA receptor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) illustrates the  degree of homology between the two molecules which  have an overall similarity of 41%. Closer inspection reveals the region of maximal homology (57% similarity,  38% identity) to be contained within the area encompassing the extended CD44 Link domain and the corresponding region (residues 36&#x02013;139) in the LYVE-1 sequence (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). The location of the putative Link module in LYVE-1  is marked by four central cysteine residues (Cys 61, 85,  106, and 128), whose spacing (C1 - X<sub>23 </sub>- C2 - X<sub>20 </sub>- C3 - X<sub>20 </sub>-  C4) is almost identical in CD44, and whose intervening sequences share 57% similarity. This similarity rises to 68%  (57% identity) between C2 (Cys 85) and C3 (Cys 106).  These four cysteine residues are conserved in all members  of the Link superfamily where they form essential disulfide bridges that stabilize the HA-binding domain, a structure comprising two &#x003b1; helices and two anti&#x02013;parallel &#x003b2;  sheets surrounding a large hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Interestingly the two additional cysteine residues Cys 31 and  Cys 133 that uniquely flank the CD44 Link module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) are also present at appropriately conserved locations  in the LYVE-1 sequence (Cys 36 and Cys 139, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A).  Downstream of the Link module, however, the region corresponding to the membrane proximal domain of LYVE-1  shows little similarity to CD44, with the exception of a  moderately high proportion of serine and threonine residues (37% within residues 145&#x02013;216). </p><p>The presence of the LYVE-1 Link module is more  clearly illustrated by sequence alignments with other human Link superfamily members including the cartilage  matrix proteins Aggrecan, Versican, and Link protein itself, each of which contain tandem repeats of the Link homology unit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). A novel feature apparent from  these alignments is that LYVE-1 and CD44 appear to  define a subgroup within the Link superfamily. These  findings suggest the divergence of the cell surface HA receptors as a separate branch from the HA-binding extracellular matrix proteins during evolution.</p><p>More detailed comparisons of individual amino acid  residues within the putative HA-binding regions of the  LYVE-1 and CD44 Link modules reveal a number of differences. For example, of the nine key residues identified  by site directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) as critical for HA binding within the human CD44 Link domain, Lys 38 &#x0002b; 68,  Arg 41 &#x0002b; 78, Tyr 42, 79, &#x0002b; 105, and Asp 100 &#x0002b; 101, only  three of these, Lys 38, Tyr 79, and Asp 100 are conserved  within the LYVE-1 molecule (residues 46, 87, and 109, respectively, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). Furthermore, the peripheral cluster  of basic amino acids located downstream of the Link module in CD44, which includes Arg 158 and Lys 162 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>  A) previously shown to be important for HA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>),  is not conserved in the LYVE-1 sequence. Hence, despite  overall similarities in Link module sequences, the specific  residues involved in the predicted LYVE-1&#x02013;carbohydrate  interaction are likely to be different from those in the  CD44 molecule.</p></sec><sec><title>The LYVE-1 Receptor Is Expressed on the Cell Surface</title><p>To confirm the identification of the LYVE-1 molecule as  an integral membrane glycoprotein, COS 1 fibroblasts  were transfected with LYVE-1 cDNA and stained with  polyclonal LYVE-1 antibodies for immunofluorescence  microscopy. The specificity of the LYVE-1 serum is characterized in detail below. As shown by the results in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>  A, the transfectants displayed intense surface staining.  Western blotting of the LYVE-1 transfected COS cells using a polyclonal serum generated against soluble LYVE-1  revealed a major band which migrated with an apparent  molecular mass of 60 kD, and which was absent from  mock transfected cells. The discrepancy between the experimentally observed value and the size predicted from  the primary sequence (35,158 D) is largely due to glycosylation, since treatment with either N-glycanase or O-glycanase/neuraminidase reduced the molecular mass by &#x0223c;20  kD (not shown). </p></sec><sec><title>LYVE-1 Binds Both Immobilized and Soluble HA</title><p>To confirm the presence of a functional HA-binding domain in the LYVE-1 receptor, we expressed the extracellular domain with its own NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal leader (residues  1&#x02013;232) as a soluble fusion protein with the hinge, CH2,  and CH3 domains of human IgG<sub>1</sub> (total length 440 residues). The purified protein migrated as a single 80-kD  band on SDS-PAGE, similar to a CD44H Fc fusion protein (total length 434 residues, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). The discrepancy  with the 46,900-D molecular mass predicted from the mature 440 residue primary sequence again is largely due to  N- and O-glycosylation of the LYVE-1 core polypeptide  (see above). </p><p>Comparison of LYVE-1 Fc with CD44 Fc in a microtiter  plate glycosaminoglycan binding assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, B and C)  revealed that LYVE-1 binds immobilized HA in a concentration-dependent manner that is similar if not identical to  CD44. In contrast, neither of the two control fusion proteins CD33 Fc or ICAM-2 Fc displayed any significant  binding over this range (0.25&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;g/ml). The specificity of  the LYVE-1 HA interaction was demonstrated by competition with free glycosaminoglycans, which showed that  neither chondroitin-4-SO<sub>4</sub>, chondroitin-6-SO<sub>4</sub>, nor heparan sulfate blocked binding even at concentrations up to  200 &#x003bc;g/ml (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C). In contrast the LYVE-1 HA interaction was extremely sensitive to inhibition by free HA (IC<sub>50</sub>  &#x0223c;3 &#x003bc;g/ml). This indicates that LYVE-1 has a much higher  specificity for glycosaminoglycan binding than either  CD44 or the cation-dependent liver endothelial receptors.  Importantly, this also distinguishes LYVE-1 from the  lymph node receptors involved in the uptake and degradation of lymph fluid HA, since these are blocked by chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).  LYVE-1 Fc also bound soluble high molecular mass HA  in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D), although  the binding capacity decreased dramatically with increasing levels of HA biotinylation (data not shown), a feature  that was not observed with CD44. This latter result suggests there is a significant difference in the size or geometry of the HA-binding surface within these two receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>LYVE-1 mRNA Has a Restricted Pattern of Tissue Expression</title><p>Expression of the LYVE-1 gene in vivo was investigated  by Northern blot hybridization to poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNAs prepared from a range of human tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Two major  bands of &#x0223c;2 and 2.6 kb were abundant in spleen, lymph  node, heart, lung, and fetal liver RNA and to a lesser degree in appendix, bone marrow, placenta, muscle, and  adult liver RNA. These were largely if not completely absent from peripheral blood lymphocytes, thymus, brain,  kidney, and pancreas RNA. In addition, minor bands of  6&#x02013;7 kb were detected to a variable extent in spleen, lymph  node, fetal liver, heart, lung, and muscle. The 2.6-kb band  is predicted to correspond to the LYVE-1 transcript  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, whereas the 2-kb band likely represents a  transcript that is polyadenylated on one or other of the  consensus AATAAA motifs at positions 1819 and 1905  within the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The minor  6&#x02013;7-kb bands have not yet been characterized. Hence it is  possible they represent alternatively spliced LYVE-1 transcripts. </p><p>Intriguingly, RT-PCR analyses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) of individual cell  lines derived from lymphocytes, myeloid cells, monocytes,  microvascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts yielded no  products in any cell type with the exception of late passage  HUVEC, and placental tissue, used as a positive control.  In contrast, each cell line yielded abundant PCR products  when amplified with primers to CD44, or the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. These  results suggested an unusually specific pattern of tissue expression for LYVE-1 that was clearly distinct from that of  the CD44 molecule. </p></sec><sec><title>The LYVE-1 Molecule Is Present on the Walls of  Lymphatic Vessels</title><p>To explore the expression pattern of the LYVE-1 protein  in more detail, we generated a polyclonal serum by immunizing rabbits with purified LYVE-1 Fc fusion protein (see  above). The serum was then preabsorbed on human IgG  Sepharose to remove contaminating Fc-reactive antibodies, followed by affinity chromatography on a LYVE-1&#x02013;Sepharose column. The specificity of the purified antiserum was established using immobilized LYVE-1 Fc fusion  protein in an ELISA assay. As shown in the top panel of  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the LYVE-1 antiserum was highly specific for  LYVE-1 Fc at dilutions below 1:100 and reacted only  weakly with the control ICAM-2 fusion protein, which in  common with LYVE-1 Fc, contains the hinge, CH2, and  CH3 domains of human IgG<sub>1</sub>. Importantly, the LYVE-1  antiserum was unreactive with a CD44H ectodomain construct CD44<sup>158his</sup> which contains a functional Link module  (residues 1&#x02013;158) expressed as a histidine-tagged bacterial  fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), with CD44H Fc and with CD44-transfected COS 1 cells (not shown). Finally, the LYVE-1 antiserum (1:100 dilution) had the capacity to completely  block binding of soluble bHA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, bottom). These data  indicate the polyclonal serum is specific for LYVE-1 and  does not exhibit reactivity with CD44, its closest homologue. </p><p>Immunoperoxidase staining of human tissues with the  polyclonal LYVE-1 serum revealed an unusual and highly  restricted expression pattern, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>. Intriguingly the expression of LYVE-1  was mostly confined to endothelial cells lining vessels of  the lymphatic system. The only other sites of prominent  LYVE-1 expression were sinusoidal endothelial cells within  the spleen and placental syncytiotrophoblasts (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> k). In contrast with the expression pattern of CD44,  no LYVE-1 was detected on lymphocytes or other hematopoietic cells within lymphoid organs such as the tonsil  and thymus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> l). Localization of LYVE-1  within the lymphatics was most strikingly visible among  the draining lymphatic vessels within the submucosae, underlying the intestinal crypts in colon and small intestine  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, a&#x02013;d). Many small lymph vessels, including some  containing large numbers of lymphocytes, showed intense  endothelial staining. High levels of LYVE-1 expression  were also apparent on the lacteal vessels draining individual intestinal villi, on subdermal lymphatic vessels within  the skin, and on lymphatic vessels within peripheral nodes  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, e&#x02013;j). A similar expression pattern was found in  other tissues displaying prominent lymphatics, particularly  the appendix and stomach (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). In contrast, no  LYVE-1 was detected on blood vessels within any of the  tissues tested. Interestingly, LYVE-1 protein expression  was detected on the surface of cultured HUVEC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>  m), confirming the detection of LYVE-1 mRNA by RT-PCR (see above). This is most likely to be the result of culture induced de-differentiation as no vascular staining was  observed in tissue sections of umbilical vein (not shown).  The selectivity for lymphatic expression is underlined by a  comparison of the two vessel types in sections of salivary  gland (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> g), where blood vessels that are clearly distinguishable by their erythrocyte content (visible through  weak nonspecific staining with rabbit IgG) are negative for  LYVE-1, while the adjacent empty lymph vessels stain intensely. This distinction was confirmed by double immunofluorescence staining of small intestine sections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>)  with antibodies to LYVE-1 and to the vascular endothelial  markers CD34 (sgp90) and vWF (Factor VIII&#x02013;related  molecule). LYVE-1 staining was mutually exclusive with  both of the other markers, and was confined to irregularly  shaped vessels within the submucosae that were devoid of  erythrocytes. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence  staining revealed little or no CD44 expression on lymphatic vessels, indicating that LYVE-1 is likely to be  the major receptor for HA on lymphatic endothelial cells  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).    </p></sec><sec><title>Physiological Function of the LYVE-1 HA Receptor</title><p>The lymphatic system is the main conduit for transport of  HA from the tissues and degradation within lymph nodes.  However, the molecules within lymphatic vessels which interact with lymph fluid HA have not been identified, and  the mechanisms driving HA transport to the lymph nodes  have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we considered the  possibilities that LYVE-1 might either sequester HA on  the lymph vessel wall or promote HA-mediated rolling of  leukocytes present within the lymph fluid. In the first instance, we looked for an association between LYVE-1 and  its ligand HA on the luminal face of tissue lymphatics by  double immunofluorescent staining, using bHABC composed of bovine Aggrecan and Link protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).  Abundant quantities of HA were detected throughout the  parenchyma and lining the walls of numerous vessels in all  the tissues tested (data not shown). A significant amount  of this HA indeed colocalized with LYVE-1 in numerous  patches (visible as yellow staining), around the luminal  surface of lymph vessels, particularly those in the small intestines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Although relatively high levels of HA (50  &#x003bc;g/ml) are normally found within lymph vessels in vivo  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), we observed some variation in the amounts retained  on LYVE-1 stained vessels between and within different  tissues. It is not yet clear whether this reflects variation in  the amount of HA, or its recovery during the preparation  of different tissues, or variation in the binding affinity of  LYVE-1 in different locations.</p><p>Finally, we looked for evidence that leukocytes adhere  to HA presented by LYVE-1 present on the lymph vessel  wall. Our initial attempts to demonstrate such adhesion  using CD44 transfected Namalwa B lymphoma cells and  frozen sections of gut lymphatics in Stamper-Woodruff  type assays were difficult to interpret, because of the high  levels of binding to HA within the surrounding parenchyma (not shown). As an alternative, we tested the ability  of LYVE-1 Fc immobilized on plastic microtiter dishes to  support HA-mediated binding to CD44. As shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>, LYVE-1 indeed supported HA-mediated binding of  CD44, regardless of the order used for primary presentation or secondary HA binding. In conclusion, our results  indicate that LYVE-1, in addition to binding HA within  the lymphatics, may also bind HA-coated lymphocytes in  transit to the lymph nodes. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The interaction between cells and extracellular matrix HA  is clearly of fundamental importance both during embryonic limb development and in processes such as wound  healing and inflammation in later adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Such  importance predicts that many receptors must be involved  in HA adhesion, and that complex mechanisms must exist  to regulate both their expression and their ligand-binding  affinity. Yet at present, the list of professional cell surface  HA receptors is small and includes only the CD44 molecule, RHAMM, and the LEC HA receptors. Furthermore,  deletion of the gene for CD44, the most abundant and  widely expressed of these, has little if any deleterious effects on the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Thus, it has become increasingly  clear to many workers in the field that additional receptors  for HA are likely to exist within the genome.</p><p>In this paper we have described the primary structure  and biological function of one such receptor, termed  LYVE-1, which is present within vessels of the lymphatic  system. This new receptor is a type I integral membrane  polypeptide whose extracellular domain encodes a single  cartilage Link module, the prototypic HA-binding domain  conserved within all members of the Link or hyaladherin  superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The central core of the LYVE-1 Link  module (C2-C3) is 57% identical to that of the human  CD44 HA receptor, the only other Link superfamily HA  receptor to be described to date and the closest homologue  of LYVE-1. Nevertheless, there are distinct differences between LYVE-1 and CD44 that suggest the two homologues differ either in the mode of HA binding or in its  regulation.</p><p>Firstly, in terms of HA binding, only three of nine residues identified as essential within the CD44 Link module  are conserved in LYVE-1 (Lys 38, Tyr 79, and Asp 100)  and none of the downstream COOH-terminal basic residues of CD44 are present. Furthermore, unlike CD44, the  affinity of LYVE-1 for bHA is drastically reduced with increasing degrees of biotinylation. These features suggest  HA is orientated differently within the LYVE-1 Link  module and suggest it may bind a larger HA unit than the  minimal HA<sub>6</sub> unit bound by CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Competition  experiments with defined HA fragment sizes will be required to distinguish between these possibilities. A further  distinction between LYVE-1 and CD44 is their dramatic  difference in substrate specificity. Unlike CD44, LYVE-1  displays exquisite specificity for binding HA and no affinity for the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin-4 sulfate,  chondroitin-6 sulfate, or heparan sulfate. This remarkable ligand specificity also distinguishes LYVE-1 from the  lymph node HA receptors which mediate the uptake and  degradation of HA from afferent lymph, a process that is  blocked by chondroitin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate  proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, the regulation of HA binding and its functional consequences are likely to differ significantly from  CD44. Excluding the Link domain and its immediate  boundaries, the LYVE-1 extracellular domain, transmembrane anchor, and cytoplasmic tail bear no similarity to  those of the CD44 molecule. In the CD44 ectodomain, alternative splicing of up to 10 exons within the membrane-proximal region regulates HA binding in some cell types  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), and introduces new ligand-binding specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Although we have detected high molecular weight  LYVE-1 transcripts in some tissues by Northern blotting  (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), we have so far not observed alternatively  spliced variants by RT-PCR. In the CD44 transmembrane  anchor, a central cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) regulates HA binding in a cell-specific manner, through the formation of  lipid domains within the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). No such residue  is present in the LYVE-1 transmembrane anchor. Lastly,  in the CD44 molecule, the 71-residue cytoplasmic tail  binds the cytoskeletal components ankyrin and ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>),  and is subject to serine phosphorylation that regulates cell  motility on HA substrata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Although the lack of sequence conservation does not rule out the possibility that  LYVE-1 interacts with these cytoskeletal components via  different residues or that the LYVE-1 cytoplasmic tail interacts with other as yet undefined molecules, it seems unlikely that the mechanisms which regulate CD44-HA interactions are duplicated for LYVE-1, its closest known  homologue.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking distinction between LYVE-1  and CD44 is in their patterns of tissue expression. Intriguingly, the LYVE-1 molecule is largely if not exclusively restricted to lymph vessel endothelial cells from which CD44  is almost completely absent. Comprehensive analyses of a  large panel of human tissues by immunoperoxidase staining with specific antisera revealed LYVE-1 lining the lymphatics in virtually every tissue where these structures  could be distinguished, and included vessels draining gastrointestinal tissues, skin, lymph nodes, breast, and salivary gland. The greatest concentration of LYVE-1 expression was seen in submucosal lymph vessels underlying  smooth muscle in the colon, and the Lacteal vessels of intestinal villi that transport dietary lipid absorbed from the  small intestine. Lymphatic vessels are morphologically distinguishable from blood vessels by their reduced or missing basement membrane and lack of erythrocyte content.  There are currently no specific immunochemical markers  that allow identification of lymphatics, although limited  studies with endothelial markers indicate differential expression of the L-selectin ligand CD34 and the coagulation  Factor VIII&#x02013;related protein vWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Our own results  using double immunofluorescence indicate that LYVE-1  defines a set of lymphatic vessels which express neither  CD34 nor vWF and identify LYVE-1 as a powerful new  marker for future studies of lymphatic structure and function.</p><p>The absence of LYVE-1 from vascular endothelial cells,  in addition to its absence from lymphocytes, macrophages,  fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, implies a rather different  physiological role from that of the CD44 molecule, which  is expressed abundantly in each of these locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) but  is largely absent from lymphatic vessels. The primary role  of the CD44 HA receptor appears to be the regulation of  cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), as evidenced by its association with the  migration of mesenchymal cells during differentiation, and  with the hematogenous spread of tumor cells in experimental neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This is also apparent in inflammation, where CD44 expression on lymphocytes promotes  migration through HA-coated vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>),  as well as the migration of lymphocytes through HA-coated reticular networks within peripheral lymph nodes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). LYVE-1 by contrast appears to be restricted to relatively nonmotile lymphatic endothelial cells, where it  seems more likely to function in the immobilization of HA  in the vessel lumen, rather than in its recognition as a positional cue for migration.</p><p>A prominent function of the lymphatic system is the  provision of fluid drainage of immune cells and foreign antigens from the tissues to the peripheral lymph nodes,  where the latter are sampled by professional antigen-presenting cells and phagocytes. Lymph fluid contains high  levels (40&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g/ml) of HA (see ref. 12 and reviewed in  ref. 10), and its flux through the lymphatics is known to increase in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis and in response to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The lymph vessels thus act as a conduit both for migrating inflammatory cells and for HA, although the precise relationship between the two is not clear. One possibility is that LYVE-1 functions as an endocytic receptor in  an analogous fashion to CD44 on macrophages and the  LEC HA receptors on liver endothelium. The specificity  of LYVE-1 for HA does, however, appear to rule out any  likelihood that it is the receptor involved in HA uptake  and degradation within the lymph node. Alternatively,  since inflammatory cells express CD44, we are tempted to  speculate that LYVE-1 molecules may promote their adhesion to lymphatic endothelium via HA. Such a role is  supported by our finding that LYVE-1 and HA colocalize  to the luminal face of the lymph vessels, and that LYVE-1  can support HA-mediated adhesion to CD44. We are  currently performing experiments to distinguish between  these and other interesting possibilities.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Nucleotide sequence and derived  amino acid sequence of LYVE-1, a novel human  HA receptor.
