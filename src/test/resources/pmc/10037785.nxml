Different genes are preferentially  transcribed and their RNAs processed in different compartments relative to SC-35 domains. These differences  do not simply correlate with the complexity, nuclear  abundance, or position within overall nuclear space.  The distribution of spliceosome assembly factor SC-35  did not simply mirror the distribution of individual pre-mRNAs, but rather suggested that individual domains  contain both specific pre-mRNA(s) as well as excess  splicing factors. This is consistent with a multifunctional  compartment, to which some gene loci and their RNAs  have access and others do not. Despite similar molar  abundance in muscle fiber nuclei, nascent transcript  &#x0201c;trees&#x0201d; of highly complex dystrophin RNA are cotranscriptionally spliced outside of SC-35 domains, whereas  posttranscriptional &#x0201c;tracks&#x0201d; of more mature myosin  heavy chain transcripts overlap domains. Further analyses supported that endogenous pre-mRNAs exhibit distinct structural organization that may reflect not only  the expression and complexity of the gene, but also  constraints of its chromosomal context and kinetics of  its RNA metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cultured cells</kwd><kwd>cell nucleus</kwd><kwd>RNA splicing</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>fluorescence in situ hybridization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>A<sc>nalysis</sc> of spatial relationships between specific  genes, their nuclear RNAs, and defined intranuclear compartments may reveal new principles  governing the integration of the genome and RNA metabolism with nuclear structure. In its functional state the genome is not a linear entity, but a major component of  three-dimensional nuclear structure, the complexities and  dynamics of which we are just beginning to understand. It  has long been speculated that the nucleus may exhibit a  higher level organization in keeping with the structure&#x02013; function relationships of cellular organelles and cytological observations of differences in chromatin distribution in  specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Comings, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Manuelidis, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Blobel, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Hochstrasser et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>).  However, the distribution of individual genes, and in  particular the relationship to pre-mRNA metabolism, remains a largely unresolved subject of long-standing interest and debate.</p><p>Here we use the postmitotic multinucleated skeletal  muscle fiber as a model system to address whether nuclear  RNAs transcribed from two coordinately regulated genes  spatially associate or occupy fixed positions within overall  nuclear space. However, distribution within total nuclear  volume is only one potential parameter of nuclear architecture; recent results lead to a more fundamental question concerning the spatial arrangement of sequences relative to defined intranuclear compartments.</p><p>As discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lawrence  et al., 1993</xref>), the clustering of rRNA genes in the nucleolus  (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Scheer et al., 1993</xref>) establishes the precedent that loci from 10 human chromosomes can spatially  associate to form a distinct structure devoted to metabolism of that RNA. It is now recognized that at least several  other nonnucleolar compartments exist, characterized by  marked enrichment for different sets of RNA metabolic  factors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Moen et al., 1995</xref>). A key to understanding the function(s) of such compartments is determining the extent to which different genes/RNAs associate with them.</p><p>Of particular interest is a compartment enriched in pre-mRNA metabolic components and poly A RNA, identified here using fluorescence antibodies raised against spliceosome assembly factor SC-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>).  The term SC-35 domains is used to indicate the 20&#x02013;40  large (0.5&#x02013;3.0 &#x003bc;) domains, as distinct from smaller entities  and coiled bodies which are also part of the small nuclear  ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)<sup>1</sup> speckled pattern. SC-35 domains are also highly enriched with numerous splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Nyman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Spector et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Blencowe et  al., 1994</xref>), poly A RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Visa et al.,  1993</xref>), a subset of poly (A) polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Schul et al., 1998</xref>),  a putative RNA helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gee et al., 1997</xref>), and a hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bregman et  al., 1995</xref>). Despite the concentration of these factors, uridine labeling is generally not detected in these regions.  This has contributed to the impression that SC-35 domains  are storage sites from which pre-mRNA is excluded and  that RNA metabolism is dispersed randomly through the  remainder of the nucleoplasm (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Fakan and  Puvion, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Wansink et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>A hypothesis investigated here is that specific gene transcription and splicing are not randomly distributed in the  interdomain compartment, and that a substantial amount  of specific pre-mRNA metabolism is associated with these  factor-rich domains. Although poly A RNA and splicing  factors are clearly present throughout the nucleoplasm  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>), statistical analysis of several loci in  the same cell type has demonstrated the precedent for  nonrandom distribution of DNA sequences relative to  these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>). Three inactive loci  showed low level association (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;20%) in keeping with  a random distribution, whereas the three active genes/ pre-mRNAs showed a high preferential association (&#x0223c;70&#x02013; 99%), suggesting a functional interaction between some  expressed genes and these domains. Similarly, nuclear  transcripts for c-fos were observed proximal to Sm speckles (Huang et al., 1991). These observations make the important point that gene distributions are not random, and  that specific pre-mRNAs can indeed be associated with  the splicing factor/poly A RNA&#x02013;rich domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al.,  1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>). Although the expressed genes studied all  showed high levels of association, only three active genes  representing abundant structural proteins were quantitatively examined and compared in this way. Based on various considerations, we suggested that association with  splicing factor-rich domains was not a property of all  spliced pre-mRNAs, but may involve a major subset representing a substantial amount of the cell's mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Clemson et al., 1996</xref>). Data supporting these hypotheses are  presented for the first time here.</p><p>Two studies that have introduced exogenous RNAs into  the nucleus either by microinjection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wang et al., 1991</xref>) or  transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Huang and Spector, 1996</xref>) have reported that  the presence of a single intron is both necessary and sufficient for complete colocalization of exogenous RNAs and  splicing factor speckles. The simplest interpretation, consistent with the colocalization of snRNPs and poly A  RNA, is that the distribution of splicing factors reflects  that of individual pre-mRNA splicing, with no spatial organization of genes, factors, or pre-mRNA metabolism.  However, results presented here indicate that the distribution of factors does not simply mirror that of individual  pre-mRNAs, in agreement with uridine labeling studies.</p><p>One way to reconcile the disparate findings of specific  pre-mRNA or transfectant RNA in domains with their apparent lack of newly synthesized RNA is to propose that  there are two different types of factor-rich domains: most  are purely storage (electron microscopic interchromatin  granule clusters), but some are purely splicing, formed  by factors actively engaged on nascent transcripts (large  masses of perichromatin fibrils). In this view, inert factors  are actively recruited from storage domains to distant sites  of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Huang and Spector, 1996</xref>), which may  have no specific spatial relationship to the storage site. An  alternative hypothesis is that individual domains contain  both specific pre-mRNAs and a disproportionately large  accumulation of splicing factors, beyond those actively engaged in splicing transcripts of a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al.,  1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Clemson and Lawrence, 1996</xref>). Several observations led to the hypothesis that individual domains are  subcompartmentalized, with transcription and splicing of  specific RNAs at the periphery and other processes related to splicing complex assembly and RNA transport in  the interior of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al.,  1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>). Consistent with this, staining for the assembly  factor SC-35 was found to define a slightly smaller domain  within the larger snRNP/poly A RNA&#x02013;rich speckle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of whether RNAs enter domains after transcription, a key question concerns whether active genes  are differentially localized, with differential access to putative reservoirs of RNA metabolic factors. This question  cannot be addressed by studies of exogenous sequences,  because transfected or viral sequences are free of long-range chromosomal context, and are often present and expressed at levels far beyond physiological expression of  even a highly active single gene. Because gene expression  normally occurs within the constraints of chromosome  structure, it is essential to investigate directly endogenous  sequences that retain their native chromosomal context  with all the incumbent complexities that influence their  spatial arrangement, and potentially their expression.  Through analysis of six active genes/pre-mRNAs (genes  and their RNA foci), this work provides evidence that  preferential localization with domains is a common, locus-specific feature of active protein coding genes, not  restricted to genes for a few highly abundant structural  proteins. Importantly, results demonstrate that this association with factor-rich domains is not a property of all active genes producing substantial accumulations of spliced  pre-mRNA. We demonstrate for the first time that pre-mRNAs are localized in a gene specific manner in one of  two nuclear compartments that differ markedly in their  immediate proximity to these concentrations of metabolic  factors.</p><p>This work emphasizes analysis of the intranuclear distribution of the muscle-specific RNAs &#x003b2;-cardiac myosin  heavy chain (MyHC) and dystrophin, which were found to  exhibit a marked difference in their compartmentalization  relative to SC-35&#x02013;defined domains. In situ analysis of the  dystrophin gene and its pre-mRNA were of particular interest for several reasons. To date, studies demonstrating  detection of specific nuclear RNAs from endogenous  genes have been for highly abundant cytoplasmic transcripts. Although human dystrophin mRNA has been estimated to represent less than 0.01% of cytoplasmic mRNA  present in adult skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hoffman et al., 1987</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Chelly et al., 1990</xref>), it remained to be determined if cytoplasmic abundance would closely correlate with abundance at the transcription site. We show here that the precursor of an extremely low abundance cytoplasmic mRNA  such as dystrophin can be much more readily detected in  the nucleus by fluorescence in situ hybridization, due to a  substantial molar accumulation of transcripts at the site of  transcription and processing. Further analyses with probes  from different parts of the dystrophin gene demonstrate  that an exceptionally high-resolution visualization of processing events along this gene is possible by fluorescence  hybridization. Since the dystrophin gene is over 50-fold  larger than the MyHC gene, a comparison of their nuclear  RNAs helps address whether the localized accumulation  of a nuclear RNA simply represents a tree of nascent transcripts on the gene, or a vectorial track of full-length transcripts in transit from the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lawrence et al., 1989</xref>) as  has been shown for collagen and fibronectin RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing  et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear RNA accumulations for different genes cannot be assumed to represent equivalent functional entities, but may  instead reflect different rate-limiting steps in nuclear RNA  metabolism for different genes. The differences in rate-limiting steps that result in dystrophin RNA trees and  MyHC RNA tracks may contribute to their differential  compartmentalization relative to SC-35 domains.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Cell Culture</title><p>Two strains of normal human diploid myoblasts, both of satellite cell origin, were used in these studies.

For both myoblast preparations, cells were seeded onto coverslips that had been treated by boiling in  0.1 N HCl, rinsed, and then autoclaved in 0.5% gelatin (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>). For propagation, cells were cultured at subconfluent density in serum-rich medium  (see below), with medium changes every other day. To induce muscle differentiation, cultures were grown to near confluence and then maintained  in low-serum medium (see below) without further medium changes until  the appearance of myotubes. For 077 cells, serum-rich growth medium  was low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME-low) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). Low-serum differentiation medium was DME-low with 10% FBS or horse serum (HS; Hyclone  Labs). Both contained 10 mg/ml gentamycin.

Hence, the methods for detecting nuclear  RNA within the myotube are distinct from those optimized for the detection of cytoplasmic RNA. The methods used here, including procedures  for nonisotopic probe preparation and fluorescence in situ hybridization,  have been published in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Johnson et al., 1991</xref>).  Two-color detection of RNA and genes simultaneously was done by sequential hybridization and detection of RNA, followed by fixation, RNase  incubation, and DNA hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al., 1995</xref>). In some experiments, after hybridization samples were reacted with monoclonal antibodies raised against the spliceosome assembly factor SC-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopy and Analysis</title><p>A <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="zeiss">Zeiss</named-content> Axioplan microscope equipped with a multiband-pass epifluorescence filter (Chroma) was used for analysis.

For two-color samples, image shifts were avoided by the use of a  filter wheel in conjunction with multiband pass filters. All scoring was  done by at least two investigators.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>Results</title><p>As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (top), MyHC and dystrophin nuclear RNAs were simultaneously visualized in postmitotic  nuclei of cultured skeletal myofibers using fluorescence  hybridization techniques optimized for detection of nuclear RNA. Initial experiments used genomic probes that  targeted sequences of similar size, thereby facilitating  comparison of the signals. Although in situ hybridization  does not provide information on the rate of transcript production, it can provide reliable comparisons of the relative  amounts of RNA present at a given time. Most often there  were two striking accumulations of MyHC RNA and one  for dystrophin, as expected for expression of both alleles  of the autosomal MyHC gene and one allele of the X-linked  dystrophin gene in female cells. Perhaps less anticipated  was that both the dimensions and intensity of the dystrophin and MyHC nuclear RNA accumulations were comparable, as illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (right). Although dystrophin RNA is a less abundant cytoplasmic mRNA than  MyHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Hoffman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Chelly et al., 1990</xref>), and the  probes used detect &#x0003c;1% of the dystrophin sequence versus &#x0223c;80% of MyHC, dystrophin nuclear RNA signal was  similar to the MyHC RNA signal. This was seen in multiple experiments irrespective of the detection method used  and even when the MyHC probe targeted a somewhat  larger sequence than the dystrophin probe (32 versus 16  kb). Hence, the apparent nuclear abundance of the dystrophin RNA signal does not result from the extremely large  size of the full dystrophin RNA. Rather, these results indicate a roughly comparable number of transcripts associated with each MyHC and dystrophin allele. </p><p>These results show that cytoplasmic abundance does not  necessarily correlate with nuclear abundance, as many factors will influence the number of transcripts associated  with a gene. Since the dystrophin gene is over 50-fold  larger than the MyHC gene, &#x0223c;50-fold more dystrophin  transcripts would have to be in production at any given  moment to achieve a given rate of completion. Other factors that will affect the amount of RNA accumulated in  the nucleus are the RNA stability, transcription initiation  rate, and potentially other rate-limiting steps in processing  and transport. For most genes, immature nuclear transcripts comprise a small, often undetectable fraction of total cellular levels. The conclusion of in situ results presented here, that the molar accumulation of dystrophin  nuclear pre-mRNA is large relative to its cytoplasmic  abundance, is supported by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Tennyson et al.  (1996)</xref>, who reported that nascent nuclear dystrophin transcripts are more abundant than mature transcripts in the  whole cell, in a molar ratio of &#x0223c;2.5:1.</p><p>If MyHC and dystrophin nuclear RNA accumulations  exclusively reflect nascent transcripts on their genes, then  it would be difficult to explain why the enormous difference in gene length did not result in a significant  difference in the dimensions of their nuclear RNA accumulations. As addressed further below, localized concentrations of a specific RNA may also reflect other rate-limiting steps in the progression of transcripts from the  gene to the cytoplasm.</p><sec><title>Association of RNA Foci with SC-35&#x02013;defined Domains</title><p>To determine the distribution of MyHC and dystrophin  nuclear RNA foci relative to SC-35 domains, cultures containing myotubes were probed for either MyHC or dystrophin nuclear transcripts and subsequently stained with antibodies against the spliceosome assembly factor SC-35  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, A&#x02013;F). Using a very narrow depth of field objective  (NA &#x0003d; 1.4) and focusing through the RNA and SC-35 signals, it was apparent if these signals occupied the same  space. In essentially all of the 50 cells analyzed, the MyHC  RNA foci colocalized with a prominent SC-35 domain  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, A&#x02013;C and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Most commonly, the MyHC RNA  accumulation detected with the genomic probe did not fill  the entire &#x0223c;1&#x02013;3-&#x003bc; domain and had a different contour.  Unlike nuclear accumulations of fibronectin and actin  mRNAs which localized to the domain periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et  al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>), the MyHC RNA was also clearly detected  within the inner region of the domain, as previously shown  for collagen 1&#x003b1;1 RNA. The accumulation of MyHC RNA  within SC-35 domains provides further evidence for the  presence of pre-mRNA in these regions, contrary to the  expectation that large factor-rich domains are storage  sites, but consistent with the uniform presence of poly A  RNA in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>). These results also suggest that MyHC transcription and splicing is associated  with the SC-35 domain, as directly demonstrated for fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>) and collagen 1&#x003b1;1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing  et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast to the similarity in size and appearance of their nuclear RNA accumulations, MyHC and  dystrophin RNA showed completely different distributions relative to the SC-35 domains. The dystrophin RNA  accumulations were never within the domains, whereas  the MyHC RNA foci consistently were. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, D&#x02013;F, with the exception of a small fraction  of cells, there was no discernible increase in SC-35 concentration coincident with the large, bright dystrophin RNA  accumulation. Since the linear dimensions of this enormous gene can extend 1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc; or more at interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lawrence et al., 1990</xref>), this analysis was repeated with cDNA  and genomic probes to different regions of the primary  transcript. These results confirmed that no part of the  dystrophin RNA focus was preferentially associated with  SC-35 domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). At most, the edge of the dystrophin RNA accumulation occasionally appeared to touch  an SC-35 domain, but the body of the RNA accumulation  did not ever closely associate with domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, D&#x02013;F  and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).  </p><p>The diametrically opposed relationship of MyHC and  dystrophin RNAs to SC-35 demonstrates for the first time  that the association between RNA polymerase II (pol II)  gene transcripts and SC-35 domains is specific to some, but  not all, active intron containing genes. Dystrophin now  provides a precedent for RNA from an actively transcribed and spliced protein-coding gene that consistently is  excluded from SC-35 domains. Association does not appear to correlate simply with the complexity or concentration of transcripts. Although dystrophin is an extremely  complex gene associated with a relatively large accumulation of nuclear transcripts of similar molar abundance to  MyHC, unlike MyHC dystrophin shows no association  with discrete accumulations of SC-35. These results suggest the possibility that dystrophin and MyHC RNA accumulations reside in different structural compartments of  the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall Spatial Relationship of Dystrophin and MyHC RNAs</title><p>The demonstration of distinct gene distributions relative  to SC-35 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al., 1995</xref> and this article), coupled with the specific three-dimensional topography of the  domains themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter et al., 1993</xref>), raises the question of whether patterns of overall nuclear position exist.  In human fibroblasts and myoblasts, SC-35 domains are  excluded from the nuclear periphery rich in heterochromatin and are further confined to a plane in the ventral  half of the nuclear volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1993</xref>). If a  given gene or chromosome is constrained to a subregion  within nuclear space, as has been recently reported in  <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>), the distribution relative  to SC-35 domains could be a coincidental result of the  gross overall positioning rather than a specific relationship  to SC-35.</p><p>The relative positions of MyHC and dystrophin RNA  foci were examined to determine whether any association  or pattern of spatial arrangement was apparent for these  coordinately expressed sequences within reiterated myofiber nuclei. Cultured myofibers most often do not have  well-aligned nuclei, hence, for part of our analysis we attempted to focus on nuclei arrayed in single file and apparently aligned relative to the linear axis of the myotube.  Cells were probed for MyHC and dystrophin RNA simultaneously, and the relative positions of signals in 51 nuclei  from 15 different 077 myotubes were recorded on drawings as represented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The three nuclear RNA accumulations (two MyHC and one dystrophin) showed highly  variable locations relative to one another. Since sometimes only one MyHC RNA focus was detected, we cannot  rule out the possibility that the two MyHC alleles associate in a minority of cells. Within the limits of our analysis,  neither nuclear RNA accumulation showed precise coordinates or had a clearly preferred pattern of distribution.  Although the dystrophin RNA focus tended to be slightly  more peripheral than MyHC (data not shown), neither  RNA showed the marked peripheral location commonly  seen for inactive neurotensin and albumin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al.,  1995</xref>). Dystrophin RNA was clearly not confined to the  peripheral region, from which SC-35 domains are excluded in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter et al., 1993</xref>). </p><p>An interesting aspect of the spatial arrangement of dystrophin RNA is most apparent in considering its distribution relative to SC-35 domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, D&#x02013;F). As viewed in  two dimensions, the dystrophin RNA accumulation was  positioned between the SC-35 domains, in the interdomain  compartment, rather than in the upper half of nuclear volume largely devoid of SC-35 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter et al., 1993</xref>).  Dystrophin RNA was not observed above or below any of  the 20&#x02013;40 prominent SC-35 domains, but rather appeared  to distribute within the same Z-axis plane as the domains  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carter et al., 1993</xref>). Hence, dystrophin and MyHC are  distributed in the same nuclear plane, and in a small fraction of nuclei (&#x0223c;6%) could even be found adjacent to one  another. However, even when they were abutting, the two  RNA accumulations remained as separate entities and did  not intermingle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, G&#x02013;I). In contrast, we have observed other RNAs which do intermingle (Shopland, L.,  and C. Johnson et al., unpublished data). Similarly, even  when dystrophin RNA was adjacent to an SC-35 domain,  the concentration of factors did not extend over the dystrophin RNA. These observations show that dystrophin  and MyHC RNA accumulations behave as separate structural entities, consistent with their residing in distinct nuclear compartments.</p><p>Our results show that the difference in distribution relative to SC-35 domains is not a coincidental result of a fixed  position within a narrow nuclear region. These results also  indicate that these coordinately expressed genes are not  specifically positioned relative to one another, but do not  rule out positional differences at a more refined level. Finally, we note that cultured muscle fibers remain physiologically immature, thus it remains possible that within the  more structured architecture of in vivo tissues a greater topographic organization of individual active genes exists.  However, such organization is clearly not necessary for either viability or differentiation in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualization of Cotranscriptional Splicing within the  Dystrophin RNA Accumulation</title><p>The finding that the large dystrophin RNA accumulation  exists outside of SC-35 domains suggests that sufficient  splicing factors are present in the interdomain space for  processing of a substantial accumulation of transcripts  from a gene containing 79 exons. To evaluate directly  whether the RNA accumulation detected was indeed undergoing splicing, we used simultaneous hybridization of  probes for different sequences within the gene. As previously indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>), for typical genes the  size of actin (6 kb) or even fibronectin (70 kb) it has not  been possible by fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate  cotranscriptional splicing, since either co- or posttranscriptional events would generally occur below the limits of resolution (0.2 &#x003bc;). However, the enormous size of the dystrophin gene allowed a level of resolution of splicing events  not previously possible by light microscopy. Simultaneous  hybridization with genomic and cDNA probes (mapped in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A) was performed to evaluate the relative distribution of transcripts with and without introns, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">1995</xref>). Because of the size of  the gene, the analysis included different combinations of  probes from the 5&#x02032; and midgene regions.</p><p>From the examination of different combinations of  probes in numerous cells, key patterns emerged. Results  from hybridization of cDNA probes suggested that the  5&#x02032;and 3&#x02032; ends of the RNA accumulation could be discriminated. For example, using 5&#x02032; cDNA (exons 1&#x02013;11) and mid-cDNA (exons 17&#x02013;27) probes, reproducible structural features of the dystrophin RNA focus were visualized. The 5&#x02032;  probe detected an elongated focus of RNA which was  larger than and completely overlapped the mid cDNA focus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, B&#x02013;D). Signals from the more 3&#x02032; cDNA probe  consistently overlapped one end of the RNA accumulation detected by the 5&#x02032; probe, consistent with the 5&#x02032; sequences being transcribed first and carried down the  length of the gene to where the 3&#x02032; sequences were transcribed. This pattern was independent of the labeling  method used.</p><p>Using a 5&#x02032; intron probe (genomic probe which detects  99% intron sequence encompassing exon 1) and a midgene intron probe (genomic probe encompassing introns 43  and 44) RNA foci were detected in a pattern consistently  distinct from that revealed by the cDNA probes. Double-label experiments using both of these genomic probes produced nonoverlapping foci (at most only a trace of 5&#x02032; sequences was seen with the more 3&#x02032; foci) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, E&#x02013;G). This  strongly suggests that these two introns, from distant parts  of the gene, did not simultaneously exist within the same  RNA molecules. The most plausible explanation of these  results is that the more 5&#x02032; introns are spliced out of nascent  RNA molecules before the 3&#x02032; end of the RNA is transcribed. This indicates cotranscriptional splicing of the primary transcript along this unusually large gene as represented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> H, consistent with results of previously  reported PCR analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Tennyson et al., 1995</xref>). Hence,  these results demonstrate that fluorescence hybridization  is capable of resolving cotranscriptional splicing events  along the dystrophin gene, and directly demonstrate that  the large RNA accumulation localized in interdomain  compartment is undergoing splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>Tracks and Trees</title><p>For several reasons it is of interest to understand whether  nuclear RNA accumulations represent nascent transcripts  or transcripts that have already dissociated from their respective genes and are in a subsequent step in the progression to nuclear export. Dystrophin and MyHC nuclear  RNA accumulations may not represent the same structural and functional entities, i.e., they do not necessarily  comprise transcripts at equivalent stages of maturation.  Despite the enormous difference in gene lengths, the  RNA accumulations associated with each gene are quite  similar in size. As would be expected for a tree of nascent  transcripts on the gene, the approximate length of the dystrophin RNA signal with the 5&#x02032; cDNA probe (&#x0223c;2 &#x003bc;m) is  very consistent with earlier measurements of the gene  length in fibroblast interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Lawrence et al.,  1990</xref>). However, the fact that the 35-kb MyHC gene sequence is much smaller than the 2,300-kb dystrophin gene  suggests that the relatively large size of the MyHC RNA  accumulation may constitute more than a tree of nascent  transcripts on the gene. Hence, we postulate that MyHC  and dystrophin RNA formations might be structurally distinct with respect to their genes.</p><p>To address this directly, we investigated the spatial configuration of the MyHC and dystrophin genes relative to  their respective RNA accumulations using a sequential  RNA and DNA hybridization strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al., 1995</xref>).  MyHC RNA and gene were visualized in two different  colors using a 32-kb &#x003b2;-cMyHC&#x02013;specific genomic probe  (see Materials and Methods and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A and B). Dystrophin RNA was visualized by using the 5&#x02032; cDNA probe  while different segments of the dystrophin gene (&#x0223c;10&#x02013;15  kb each) were delineated using the 5&#x02032; and midgenomic  probes (see Materials and Methods and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, C and D). </p><p>The dystrophin RNA was examined in one color in the  same nucleus with the two DNA sequences marking distant gene segments (1 Mb apart) in another color. The  50MB-1 cells used are male, so only 1 X-linked dystrophin  gene is present. The pattern observed most often is shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> C. Here we show that the dystrophin RNA accumulation generally surrounds the two point signals produced by DNA hybridization with the two genomic  probes, and often the longer axis of the RNA signal lies  parallel to the axis connecting the two gene segments. This  overlap is in keeping with a tree of nascent transcripts  around the gene locus, as represented in the model in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> D. These and the above results collectively demonstrate that the dystrophin RNA accumulation represents a  Christmas tree of nascent transcripts undergoing cotranscriptional splicing, with introns removed from the nascent  pre-mRNA as transcription and splicing move in a 3&#x02032; direction across the gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> H). This process consistently  occurs in a nuclear compartment that is comparatively low  in splicing factors.</p><p>Results of the DNA/RNA analysis were clearly different for MyHC. The DNA hybridization signal from a 32-kb MyHC probe was a small (0.1&#x02013;0.2 &#x003bc;) round spot, indistinguishable from that observed above for hybridization to  either of the 10&#x02013;15-kb dystrophin sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A).  This is consistent with studies of the packaging of interphase chromatin which have shown sequences of this  length to be at or below the resolution of light microscopy  (0.2 &#x003bc;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Lawrence et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Trask et al., 1989</xref>).  When gene and RNA were examined simultaneously in  two colors it was clear that the MyHC RNA signal was not  only much larger than the DNA signal, but was consistently displaced to one side of it (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A and B). Rather  than being positioned amid the RNA accumulation, as  were dystrophin DNA signals, the MyHC gene signals  were usually at the edge of the MyHC RNA accumulation.  The fact that this polar configuration of DNA and RNA  was not typically seen for dystrophin supports the interpretation that the apparent track of MyHC RNA emanating to one side of the gene reflects a bona fide biological  distribution and not an artifact of the visualization technique.</p><p>These results indicate that nuclear accumulations of dystrophin and MyHC RNA do not constitute equivalent  functional entities. The results with dystrophin are essentially as one would predict for nascent molecules amassed  on the enormous gene. However, the MyHC results do not  fit the tree model, but rather are indicative of a track comprised largely of a posttranscriptional RNA accumulation  to one side of the gene. We interpret these results to suggest that transcription is likely the rate-limiting step in  RNA export for the dystrophin locus, whereas for MyHC  posttranscriptional events may not keep pace with the  rapid transcription of MyHC, resulting in an accumulation  of RNA at a step subsequent to transcription. Although  we believe the track is comprised of intact transcripts that  enter the SC-35 domain, we do not suggest that MyHC  splicing is posttranscriptional (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Association of Transcribed Genes with SC-35 Domains  Is Locus Specific</title><p>The above results conclusively demonstrate a differential  localization of MyHC and dystrophin RNAs relative to  large accumulations of splicing factors in muscle cell nuclei. If this reflects different structural relationships relative to a nuclear compartment rich in RNA metabolic  factors, rather than merely different amounts of splicing  factors bound to these two pre-mRNAs, then differences  in the structural association of other active genes/pre-mRNAs would be expected. Although a variety of observations favor the former (see Discussion), the extreme  difference in size and potential transcription rates of dystrophin and MyHC may be considered to complicate the  interpretation. For this reason, we examined four other active genes/RNAs whose size and expression levels are not  as disparate as MyHC and dystrophin. These included the  genes for transcription factor E2F4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Ginsberg et al., 1994</xref>),  the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C (LMNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lin  and Worman, 1993</xref>), lamin B receptor (LBR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Schuler et  al., 1994</xref>), and lamin B1 (LMNB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lin and Worman,  1995</xref>). Although not muscle specific, these four commonly  expressed genes are roughly similar in size and complexity.  Furthermore, their expression levels are more moderate,  in between the highly expressed MyHC gene and dystrophin. Thus, they are good candidates for addressing  whether SC-35 domain association is contingent upon  these factors.</p><p>For all four of these genes, the nuclear RNA accumulations generally produced small spot-like signals, smaller  than either the dystrophin or MyHC nuclear RNA signals.  This suggests that the signals largely comprise nascent  transcripts on the gene (although there was sometimes a  suggestion of RNA tracks for LMNA). Analysis of these  genes/RNAs relative to SC-35 in fibroblasts demonstrated  striking differences in levels of association with the prominent SC-35 domains, as seen in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. In the vast  majority of cells, LMNA and E2F4 were not visibly separate from the SC-35 domains, whereas the LMNB1 and  LBR genes/RNAs remained spatially separate, even when  they were in the vicinity of a domain. The low levels of apparent association of these two sequences are similar to  that previously seen for inactive genes and are consistent  with random expectations within the limits of microscopic  resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al., 1995</xref>). As viewed by light microscopy, LMNA and E2F4 contacted SC-35 domains four- to  fivefold more often than LMNB1 and LBR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). This  represents a significant level of association for genes that  are not nearly as highly expressed as MyHC in muscle  cells, and is higher than the level of association reported  for fibronectin with SC-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>). It should be  noted that these sequences were studied in a cycling fibroblast population, which may introduce some variability between cells; e.g., E2F4 expression varies during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Sardet et al., 1995</xref>). The nonrandom association of a  regulatory gene such as E2F4 establishes that the spatial  association with domains is not restricted to genes for the  most abundant structural proteins. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that such organization is  common and involves a substantial subset of protein coding genes. These results lead us to conclude that association with SC-35 domains is locus specific and not solely dependent upon gene size, complexity or expression level.  They further indicate that within the constraints of nuclear  structure, active loci have differential access to the immediate and copious supply of RNA metabolic factors in the  interchromatin domains, visualized here by immunofluorescence to assembly factor SC-35. Further implications of  these results are considered in the Discussion.  </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that endogenous genes/pre-mRNAs are preferentially expressed in a locus-specific  manner in one of two distinct nuclear compartments, as  defined by immediate proximity to regions highly enriched  in splicing factors. In addition, results provide further evidence that newly synthesized RNAs are commonly associated with fluorescent SC-35 domains or prominent speckles. In the vast majority of cells, genes for MyHC, E2F4,  and LMNA are expressed directly at the periphery of SC-35&#x02013;defined domains, whereas dystrophin, LMNB1, and  LBR are not. Results indicate that the difference is not  a coincidence of fixed positions within overall nuclear  topography or a result of the abundance of pre-mRNA  transcripts present. Results support that splicing factor distribution does not simply reflect factors binding to pre-mRNAs from randomly distributed genes, consistent with  earlier studies showing that interchromatin granule cluster  and SC-35 domains are structurally and functionally specialized regions of the nucleoplasm. Although initially debated, there is increasing acceptance that transcription and  splicing can occur in the periphery of fluorescent domains.  Whether or not one views the interior region of the  speckle as strictly a storage site devoid of pre-mRNA, results shown here demonstrate a previously unknown paradigm of nuclear architecture involving locus-specific differences in the immediate access of active genes to these  supplies of splicing factors. As discussed below, whether  or not a gene associates with these regions likely depends  not only upon its expression and complexity, but also upon  constraints of its chromosomal context.</p><p>As suggested here for MyHC (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B), other results directly demonstrate that, for genes that associate  with domains, association is linked to cell type&#x02013;specific expression (Moen et al., manuscript in preparation). For  MyHC and dystrophin, the simplest interpretation might a  priori be that the difference in SC-35 association merely reflects the amount of splicing factors bound to each of their  pre-mRNAs. However, results show that it is not that simple, and that the domain associated with MyHC is not  formed merely by splicing factors bound to unspliced  MyHC transcripts. Although the RNA foci for MyHC and  dystrophin are comparable in size and intensity when  probes of similar size are used, suggesting similar numbers  of transcripts, the difference in localization with SC-35 is  striking. Clearly, the lower level factors throughout the  nucleoplasm are sufficient to splice the large nuclear accumulation of dystrophin RNA with its 74 introns. The  abundant accumulation of splicing factors associated with  MyHC lies primarily adjacent to the gene, rather than on  it, indicating the domain behaves more as a structure than  as a diffuse accumulation of splicing factors on nascent or  dispersed RNA. Further, the MyHC RNA track, as detected with a genomic probe, frequently does not occupy  the whole SC-35 domain. The absence of overlap of dystrophin RNA and SC-35 foci gives the strong impression  that this RNA is excluded from splicing factor domains;  even when dystrophin and MyHC accumulations are extremely close they do not overlap, suggesting that structural constraints may separate them. </p><p>The exclusion of dystrophin, LMB1, and LBR from SC-35 domains contrasts with other results on microinjected  sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Wang et al., 1991</xref>) or transfected sequences  (Huang et al., 1996), which indicated that the presence of a  single intron was sufficient to cause an association with snRNP or SC-35 speckles. Although the presence of intron  sequences may be necessary for this association, results  presented here clearly show it is not sufficient for endogenous genes/RNAs. However, the behavior of extrachromosomal sequences may not accurately reflect the structural relationships of endogenous genes. Unlike viruses,  plasmids, or microinjected sequences (which have been  more commonly examined), our results indicate that for  endogenous genes organizational/structural differences in  their chromosomal context can impact their proximity and  access to factor-rich regions.</p><sec><title>Tracks Versus Trees: Different Rate-limiting Steps in  RNA Metabolism for Different Genes</title><p>These results provide further evidence for the existence of  RNA tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lawrence et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Xing et al., 1993</xref>), and  demonstrate that nuclear RNA accumulations from different genes do not necessarily represent the same structural  or functional entities. Results show the dystrophin RNA  accumulation represents primarily a tree of nascent transcripts on an unusually long gene, for which transcription  is logically rate limiting. This contrasts with a track of transcripts extending vectorially beyond the much smaller, but  also complex, MyHC gene. These results counter the argument that localized RNA accumulations logically represent nascent transcripts and not posttranscriptional accumulations or RNA tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Zachar et al., 1993</xref>). Such  interpretations may be based on two presumptions: (a)  that the rate-limiting step in nuclear RNA metabolism and  export for all pre-mRNAs is transcription, and (b) that  <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes accurately reflect the  structure of mammalian interphase nuclei.</p><p>Despite our conclusion that the dystrophin accumulation is largely cotranscriptional and the MyHC RNA accumulation largely posttranscriptional, we do not interpret  this to show that MyHC splicing itself is largely posttranscriptional, even though the RNA overlaps the SC-35 domain. As previously suggested and further addressed elsewhere for the similar case of collagen (col) 1&#x003b1;1 RNA,  results favor that splicing is largely cotranscriptional and  at the periphery of the SC-35 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing et al., 1995</xref>)  (Johnson et al., manuscript in preparation). If so, then the  posttranscriptional track of MyHC RNA that accumulates  in the domain is already largely spliced. This further supports that the domain may contain both specific mRNAs  as well as an abundance of RNA metabolic factors, beyond those immediately engaged on transcripts of that  gene. As discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Xing  et al., 1995</xref>), we hypothesize that at each SC-35 domain,  multiple functions related to RNA metabolism occur including metabolism of some specific pre-mRNAs, preassembly and disassembly of splicing factors, and potential  transport of mRNA. The possibility of a role in RNA export will be addressed more directly elsewhere (Johnson  et al., manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec><title>Categories of Spatial Relationships</title><p>These results triple the number of endogenous active  genes that have been examined relative to this subnuclear  compartment, allowing us to begin to categorize the different spatial distributions observed, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A. Of  genes that associate with SC-35 domains, all localize at the  domain periphery, however there is a clear difference in  the distribution of their nuclear RNAs. MyHC RNA extends from the domain periphery into the central region,  similar to collagen RNA. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, we term  this a Type I association, as distinct from the Type II associations exhibited by RNAs such as E2F4 and LMNA.  Type II RNAs are visible only at the periphery of a domain, and are associated with high frequency (70&#x02013;95%),  but not as consistently as Type I RNAs which overlap SC-35 domains essentially 100% of the time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). We  speculate that the difference in whether the RNA is observed within the domain may be a function of different  relative rates of transcription versus posttranscriptional  steps, e.g., whether the RNA forms a track or a tree.</p><p>The different categories of association observed contribute to a more detailed hypothesis for domain formation.  Previously we showed that after mitosis, the clustering of  poly A RNA in domains preceded the clustering of snRNPs, leading us to suggest that domain formation may be  linked to gene expression in a manner roughly analogous  to formation of the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Carter et al., 1991</xref>). In this  model, domains would be nucleated at sites of highest pre-mRNA transcription and splicing such as the highly expressed and complex Type I RNAs for MyHC and col 1&#x003b1;1.  As a smaller accumulation of factors begins to associate  with a site of one or more highly active Type I gene/ RNA(s), the tendency will be for that accumulation to  grow into a large globular domain, reflecting an inherent  tendency for splicing factors to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Wu and Maniatis,  1993</xref>). Perhaps due to an affinity of their pre-mRNAs for  those same factors, other active genes will, within the constraints of their interphase chromosome structure, tend to  cluster at or around these regions where access to metabolic factors is great. This secondary clustering of other active genes/pre-mRNAs (Type II RNAs) will tend to draw  more factors, contributing further to the growth of the domain in a dynamic process. But because protein-coding  genes reside within chromosomal structure that imposes  constraints, not all genes can have equal access to these regions. If Type I genes do have a dominant influence on  where domains form, then a locus which resides in the  neighborhood of such a gene may be in a favorable position to associate with the domain. In contrast, some active  genes not residing in these neighborhoods would not associate with SC-35 domains at a frequency any different  from that of inactive sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). As previously  suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Lawrence et al., 1993</xref>), these observations raise  implications for locus-specific influences on levels of gene  expression since association with domains could facilitate  efficient gene expression. This might eventually even provide some rationale for the clustering distribution of genes  in metaphase chromosome bands.</p><p>Results presented here point to a nucleus that is functionally organized, but which resists attempts to reduce  that organization to any single paradigm. We suggest that  the spatial arrangement of endogenous genes or RNAs  must be considered in terms of the combined effect of  multiple structural and biochemical factors, including the  expression and complexity of the sequence, the structural  context within the chromosome, and the dynamics of different steps in RNA metabolism. As will be addressed  elsewhere, disruptions of these structural relationships  may be key to the cellular pathogenesis of specific diseases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Structure of the dystrophin RNA track.  (A) Map of relative positions of dystrophin  probes. All distances are approximations due to  the lack of a detailed map of the entire dystrophin gene locus. The dystrophin gene is represented by equally spaced hash marks that represent exons. The variability of intron sizes is not  represented here. Positions of the two genomic  and two cDNA probes relative to the dystrophin  gene and mRNA are shown. (B&#x02013;D) 5&#x02032; cDNA sequences overlap more 3&#x02032; sequences. 5&#x02032; cDNA  signal (B, red) runs into and overlaps the mid  cDNA signal (C, green) as seen in the combined  photo (D), indicating that 5&#x02032; sequences are transcribed first and carried along as midgene exons  are transcribed. (E&#x02013;G) RNA sequences seen  with 5&#x02032; intron sequences do not overlap more 3&#x02032;  intron sequences. 5&#x02032; genomic sequences (E, red)  do not overlap midgene genomic sequences (F,  green) as shown in the combined photo (G).  Both probes are almost entirely intron sequences. Only minute amounts of 5&#x02032; sequences  can be seen overlapping the midgene RNA signal. Separation suggests that the intron sequences are cleaved out of the transcribing  RNA. (H) Model of cotranscriptional processing  of dystrophin RNA. As RNA is transcribed  along the gene, introns are spliced out, whereas  the spliced exons move down the gene. So the intron foci would appear spatially separate and the  5&#x02032; and midgene exon tracks would overlap.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9809045.f5"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Detection of MyHC  and dystrophin RNA foci in  myotube nuclei (left).

(A) RNA foci of genes examined to date exhibit three  distributions relative to SC-35 domains. Type I associations are defined by an RNA  that overlaps the SC-35 domain. This type of association is evident in MyHC and  collagen RNAs. In Type II  associations demonstrated by  LMNA and E2F4, the RNA  signal is seen at the periphery  of the SC-35 domain. Nonassociated RNA signals such  as dystrophin, LMNB1, and  LBR are visibly separate  from the SC-35&#x02013;rich domains. Inactive genes are  also not associated with SC-35 domains. (B) Frequency  of association with SC-35 of  genes and RNAs studied to  date. The five known associated genes/RNAs (all active,  green) contact SC-35 domains at least 70% of the  time with the two Type I  genes collagen and MyHC  approaching 100%. The four  active (green) nonassociated  genes/RNAs are seen with  SC-35 domains less than 20%  of the time, at a level comparable to inactive genes (red).
