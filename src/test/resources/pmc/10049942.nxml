Of these receptors, NKp44 is selectively expressed by IL-2&#x02013; activated NK cells and may contribute to the increased efficiency of activated NK cells to mediate tumor cell lysis. Here we describe the molecular cloning of NKp44. Analysis of the  cloned cDNA indicated that NKp44 is a novel transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the  Immunoglobulin superfamily characterized by a single extracellular V-type domain. The  charged amino acid lysine in the transmembrane region may be involved in the association of  NKp44 with the signal transducing molecule killer activating receptor&#x02013;associated polypeptide  (KARAP)/DAP12. These molecules were found to be crucial for the surface expression of  NKp44. In agreement with data of NKp44 surface expression, the NKp44 transcripts were  strictly confined to activated NK cells and to a minor subset of TCR-&#x003b3;/&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes.  Unlike genes coding for other receptors involved in NK cell triggering or inhibition, the  NKp44 gene is on human chromosome 6.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>activating receptor</kwd><kwd>natural cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin  superfamily</kwd><kwd>cDNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The mechanism by which NK cells lyse certain virally  infected or tumor cells while sparing normal cells has  recently been elucidated. They express MHC class I&#x02013;specific  inhibitory receptors (killer inhibitory receptors [KIRs])<sup>1</sup>  that block NK cell function when interacting with their  ligand(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Thus, the expression of inadequate amounts  of MHC molecules at the cell surface renders cells susceptible to NK cell lysis. On the other hand, the molecular  mechanism(s) responsible for NK cell triggering remains  largely unknown. Although the activating counterparts  of KIRs have been identified (killer activating receptors  [KAR]), their contribution to NK cell triggering is clearly  limited to the case of MHC class I<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> target cells. However,  a major function of NK cells is to kill cells that do not express MHC class I molecules, thus implying a major role in  NK cell triggering of receptors recognizing non-MHC  ligands. In this context, we have recently described two  novel, highly NK-specific, receptor molecules (termed  NKp46 and NKp44) that are involved in NK cell triggering during the process of natural cytotoxicity. Whereas  NKp46 is expressed by all resting and activated NK cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), NKp44 is selectively expressed by NK cells only upon  culture in IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In this respect, the de novo expression  of NKp44 may play a relevant role in the marked increase  of cytolytic activity displayed by the so-called LAK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)  that have been used in the adoptive immunotherapy of  cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Molecular cloning of NKp46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) has recently  revealed a novel member of the Ig superfamily (Ig-SF) associated to CD3&#x003b6;, a signal transducing molecule containing  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM).  In this study, we report the molecular cloning of NKp44.  NKp44 also represents a novel member of the Ig-SF which  differs from NKp46 in that it is associated with the recently  identified signal transducing molecule killer activating  receptor&#x02013;associated polypeptide (KARAP)/DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).  Moreover, the gene encoding NKp44 is located on human  chromosome 6 whereas NKp46 and most of the NK receptors belonging to the Ig-SF are encoded by genes on  chromosome 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>cDNA Library Construction.</title><p>The expression cDNA library  was prepared in VR1012 plasmid (Vical Inc.) using RNA extracted from IL-2&#x02013;activated polyclonal NK cells as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and was divided into 10 fractions of &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> clones each.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Library Screening by cDNA Expression in COS-7 Cells.</title><p>The library screening procedure was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

To this  end, a cDNA library was prepared from human NK cells  and divided into 10 fractions of &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup> independent recombinant clones. Individual fractions were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells and analyzed by immunocytochemical staining using the prototype NKp44-specific mAb Z231  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The first screening yielded 2 (out of 10) positive fractions. By subsequent screening of progressively smaller  cDNA library pools, we obtained positive fractions, each  containing &#x0223c;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> recombinants. Further attempts aimed  at obtaining positive pools of smaller size (e.g., 500 recombinants/pool) were unsuccessful. However, cotransfection  of pairs of these small pools allowed us to identify two  pools (termed C67 and C68) yielding Z231<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> COS-7 cells.  Since individual transfection of C67 and C68 pools gave  negative results, a possible explanation was that NKp44 expression at the surface of COS-7 cells required cotransfection with other molecule(s). On the basis of this assumption, the C67 fraction was transfected with progressively  smaller pools of C68. A single clone (clone 15C) was isolated that could direct surface expression of the NKp44  protein when cotransfected with the C67 fraction. Since  we recently demonstrated that NKp44 is associated with  KARAP/DAP12 ITAM-bearing molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), we analyzed whether these molecules were required for NKp44  expression at the cell surface. Indeed, cotransfection of  clone 15C and DAP12 cDNAs resulted in surface expression of NKp44 (not shown). This clearly indicated that  clone 15C encoded the NKp44 molecule. Importantly, in  agreement with these results, DAP12 cDNA could be amplified by PCR from the C67 library fraction, thus confirming that, at least in COS-7 cells, DAP12 is required for  the surface expression of NKp44.</p><p>Next, COS-7 cells were either cotransfected with NKp44  ORF and DAP12 cDNAs or transfected separately with  the individual constructs and stained with different anti-NKp44 mAbs (including Z231, AZ140, and KS38). Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A shows that COS-7 cells were efficiently stained by the  anti-NKp44 mAbs only when cotransfected with both  NKp44 ORF and DAP12 cDNAs. On the contrary, COS-7  cells transfected with NKp44 ORF cDNA alone either  failed to express NKp44 or (in some experiments) displayed  a low level of NKp44 surface expression. As illustrated in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B, the expression of NKp44 and DAP12 mRNA in  COS-7 cell transfectants was checked both by RT-PCR  and by dot blot analysis. Surface molecules reacting with  anti-NKp44 mAb were immunoprecipitated from <sup>125</sup>I surface labeled COS-7 cells transfected with NKp44 ORF and  DAP12 cDNAs. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> C, the surface molecules immunoprecipitated from COS-7 cell transfectants  (lane e) displayed a molecular size similar to that of molecules isolated from activated NK cells (lane b). </p><p>Notably, cotransfection of COS-7 cells with NKp44  ORF and cDNAs encoding for other ITAM-bearing molecules, such as CD3&#x003b6; or Fc&#x003b5;RI&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), did not result in  NKp44 surface expression (not shown). Thus, we can  conclude that neither CD3&#x003b6; nor Fc&#x003b5;RI&#x003b3; can substitute  KARAP/DAP12 to allow surface expression of NKp44. In  this context, we previously showed that, in activated NK  cells, NKp44 molecules do not associate with CD3&#x003b6; molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A, we show that NKp44 do not associate with Fc&#x003b5;RI&#x003b3; chains either. On the other hand, Fc&#x003b5;RI&#x003b3;  associated with NKp46. Remarkably, the use of an antiserum specific for the recently cloned DAP12 molecules formally demonstrates that DAP12 is identical to the previously described NKp44-associated KARAP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B, in NKp44 immunoprecipitates  derived from activated NK cells treated with sodium pervanadate, the DAP12-specific antiserum recognized both  nonphosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated KARAP  molecules. Moreover, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C, tyrosine phosphorylation of the NKp44-associated KARAP/DAP12  molecules also occurred when cross-linking of NKp44  molecules was induced by a specific mAb. Taken together,  these data may suggest a direct involvement of KARAP/ DAP12 molecules in the signal transduction leading to the  NKp44-dependent NK cell activation. </p><p>Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the 1,192-bp  isolated cDNA (clone 15C) contained a 828-bp ORF preceded by a 338-bp 5&#x02032; untranslated region. The ORF encoded a 276&#x02013;amino acid (aa) type I transmembrane protein  belonging to the Ig-SF. This protein is characterized by a  21-aa leader sequence, a 169-aa extracellular region, a  23-aa transmembrane portion, and a 63-aa cytoplasmic tail  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Two cysteines in the extracellular region (positions  19 and 88 of the mature protein) determine the formation  of a single Ig-related domain of the V type. Thus, the  NKp44 V domain displays the typical long spacing (68 aa)  between the two conserved cysteines as well as an arginine  at position 59 and an aspartic acid at position 82 characteristic of Ig V domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). It also displays an additional pair  of cysteines at positions 34 and 42, possibly involved in the  formation of a second disulphide bond similar to that described in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal V domain of the poly Ig  receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The membrane-proximal region of the  NKp44 receptor contains a high proportion of proline  (20%), serine (16%), and threonine (13%). By analogy with  other Ig-SF members, this region is predicted to display an  extended open conformation typical of hinge-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Computer search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) revealed seven serine  and six threonine residues in the hinge-like region as putative O-glycosylation sites and an asparagine at position 159  as a potential N-linked glycosylation site. The predicted  molecular mass of the NKp44 polypeptide is &#x0223c;29 kD.  Thus, glycosylation of the molecule may account for the  apparent molecular mass (44 kD) of the glycoprotein isolated from normal NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The transmembrane portion contains the positively charged amino acid lysine. This  may be involved in the association with the negatively  charged residue aspartic acid contained in the transmembrane region of KARAP/DAP12 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The cytoplasmic tail of NKp44 contains the amino acid sequence  ILYHTV, which fits the consensus sequence for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (i.e.,  I/LxYxxL/V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Remarkably, this motif is typical of all  the HLA class I&#x02013;specific inhibitory receptors, while none of  the activating NK receptors identified so far (including  CD16, p50, and NKp46) display ITIM in their cytoplasmic  region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). On the other hand, it should be stressed that  other surface receptors that are involved in cell activation,  such as the erythropoietin receptor, the stem cell factor receptor, and the IL-3 receptor &#x003b2; chain, are characterized by  a cytoplasmic tail containing ITIM sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The  homology of NKp44 with known proteins was confined to  the Ig-like V domain and limited to few members of the Ig  superfamily. In particular, a low degree of homology was  observed between the Ig-like V domain of NKp44 and that  of the human poly-Ig receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) (25% identity) and of  the human CMRF35 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) (29% identity). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Cellular Distribution of NKp44 Transcripts.</title><p>Northern blot  analysis was performed on RNA isolated from clonal and  polyclonal NK cells as well as from LCL721.221 and Jurkat  cell lines. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, hybridization with the  NKp44 ORF probe yielded two transcripts of &#x0223c;3.7 and  1.2 kb. Since the cloned 1.2-kb cDNA encodes for a 44-kD protein that is specifically recognized and immunoprecipitated by anti-NKp44 mAbs, it is likely that the long  3.7-kb transcript may use a different polyadenylation site  located 3&#x02032; with respect to the 1.2-kb transcript. Moreover,  analysis of the cDNA sequence 5&#x02032; to the ATG initiation  codon showed that there are four in-frame stop codons,  making it unlikely that the 3.7-kb transcript may encode  for a longer protein (not shown). Whereas &#x003b2;-actin hybridization showed that similar amounts of RNA were loaded  in each lane, the amount of NKp44 mRNA varied considerably among different NK cell clones or populations analyzed. This is consistent with previous data indicating that  the amount of NKp44 expressed at the cell surface differs  among NK cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). </p><p>Further analysis of the expression of NKp44 and DAP12  mRNA in different cell populations of lymphoid origin  and in hemopoietic human cell lines was performed by a  semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> shows that  all IL-2&#x02013;cultured NK cell populations and clones analyzed  (all reactive with anti-NKp44 mAbs) expressed both  NKp44 and DAP12 transcripts. On the contrary, fresh PBL  expressed DAP12 but not NKp44 transcript, in agreement  with the lack of surface reactivity with anti-NKp44 mAb.  This is consistent with previous data indicating that only  activated NK cells express surface NKp44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Likewise, all  TCR-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones were not stained by anti-NKp44  mAb and did not express the NKp44 transcript. The  DAP12 transcript was only expressed in one of the clones  analyzed; notably, this clone (R3.2) expressed the p50.2  activating receptor, known to associate with KARAP/ DAP12 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Among TCR-&#x003b3;/&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones,  most did not express surface NKp44 molecules. However,  two of them expressed DAP12 transcripts. Two TCR-&#x003b3;/&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cell clones (17.12 and 17.31), isolated from a single donor,  displayed low levels of surface NKp44 and expressed both  NKp44 and DAP12 transcripts. In both clones, the NKp44  receptor was functional, as revealed by redirected killing assays in the presence of anti-NKp44 mAbs (not shown). We  also analyzed several human cell lines of different histotype.  All these lines lacked surface expression of NKp44 and did  not display NKp44 transcripts; on the other hand, the  DAP12 transcript was also expressed in cells of nonlymphoid  origin. Unlike normal activated NK cells, the two NK cell  lines analyzed (NK3.3 and NKL) displayed neither surface  NKp44 molecules nor NKp44 transcripts.</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Conservation Across Species and Chromosomal Localization of  the NKp44 Gene.</title><p>Southern blot analysis of the NKp44  gene was performed on genomic DNA extracted from human, monkey, and mouse cells and digested with three different restriction enzymes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Hybridization performed with the NKp44 ORF probe under low stringency  conditions revealed a relatively simple hybridization pattern  for the NKp44 gene. Interestingly, cross-species hybridization could be observed with both monkey and mouse genomic DNA. These data suggest that the NKp44 ORF  probe hybridizes with a single or relatively few human  genes and that the NKp44 gene may be conserved between  humans and rodents. </p><p>Chromosomal localization of the NKp44-encoding gene  was determined by two different approaches. First, we performed Southern blot analysis, using genomic DNA derived from a panel of polychromosomal human&#x02013;hamster  cell hybrids. Hybridization with the NKp44 ORF cDNA  probe showed segregation of the NKp44 gene on human  chromosome 6. The same conclusion was achieved by  PCR analysis of a panel of genomic DNA extracted from  monochromosomal human&#x02013;hamster cell hybrids by using  NKp44 specific primers (not shown). Taken together,  these results indicate that the NKp44 gene is localized on  human chromosome 6.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study reports the molecular cloning of  NKp44, a NK-specific triggering receptor involved in  non-MHC&#x02013;restricted natural cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Different  from NKp46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which is expressed by all resting and  activated NK cells, NKp44 is selectively expressed by activated human NK cells. In this context, it is well known  that culture in IL-2 greatly enhances the NK-mediated  anti-tumor cytotoxicity both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).  It is conceivable that the increased cytolytic activity mediated by activated NK cells may be consequent, at least in  part, to the de novo expression of triggering receptors.  NKp44 may well represent one of these receptors since it is  involved in triggering of activated NK cells in the process  of tumor cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Molecular cloning revealed that NKp44 is a type I glycoprotein belonging to the Ig-SF, which does not display  any major amino acid sequence homology with known  proteins. NKp44 is characterized by an extracellular region  containing an Ig-like domain of the V type. The transmembrane portion contains the charged amino acid lysine,  possibly involved in the association with KARAP/DAP12  molecules. Indeed, biochemical data confirmed that NKp44  associates with KARAP/DAP12 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover,  molecular cloning of NKp44 demonstrated that the association with KARAP/DAP12 molecules is required for the  surface expression of NKp44.</p><p>Interestingly, the cytoplasmic tail of NKp44 contains a  classical ITIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In this context, it is of note that, under  the experimental conditions resulting in a strong tyrosine  phosphorylation of the KARAP/DAP12 molecules associated to the NKp44 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), no tyrosine phosphorylation of the NKp44 molecule itself could be detected.  Moreover, under the same experimental conditions, no evidence has been obtained so far that NKp44 may associate  with phosphatases such as SHP-1, SHP-2, or SHIP, which  have been reported to associate with ITIM-bearing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The functional role of this ITIM is presently under investigation.</p><p>Remarkably, unlike most of the genes encoding Ig-SF  receptors involved in the regulation of NK cell&#x02013;mediated  cytolytic activity (including KIR [1], KAR [1], NKp46 [7],  and ILT/LIR [26, 27]), which are on human chromosome  19, the NKp44 gene is on chromosome 6. Southern blot  analysis of human genomic DNA revealed a restriction enzyme digestion pattern that is compatible with the existence of a single NKp44 gene. Moreover, the NKp44 gene  appears to be conserved across species since the human  NKp44 ORF cDNA probe cross-hybridized with genomic  DNA from monkey and mouse. It will be of interest to analyze whether the murine counterpart of NKp44 exists and  whether its expression is restricted to NK cells and to a  subset of TCR-&#x003b3;/&#x003b4;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes as it occurs in humans.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><table-wrap position="float" id="TI"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>NKp44
