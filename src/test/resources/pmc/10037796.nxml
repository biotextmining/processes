Chemokines mediate their effects via interaction with seven transmembrane G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCR). Using CCR5-transfected HEK-293  cells, we show that both the CCR5 ligand, RANTES, as  well as its derivative, aminooxypentane (AOP)- RANTES, trigger immediate responses such as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  influx, receptor dimerization, tyrosine phosphorylation,  and G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> as well as JAK/STAT association to the receptor. In contrast to RANTES, (AOP)-RANTES is unable to trigger late responses, as measured by the association of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to the  chemokine receptor complex, impaired cell polarization required for migration, or chemotaxis. The results  are discussed in the context of the dissociation of the  late signals, provoked by the chemokines required for  cell migration, from early signals.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chemokines</kwd><kwd>receptor dimerization</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>R<sc>antes</sc> is a member of the continuously growing  family of chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines).  The members of this group of low molecular  weight proinflammatory cytokines are characterized by  their ability to induce migration and activation of specific  leukocyte subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Schall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Schall and Bacon, 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Baggiolini, 1998</xref>). There are two major chemokine subfamilies, the CXC or &#x003b1; chemokines (in which the two cysteines nearest the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus are separated by a single  amino acid) and the CC or &#x003b2; chemokines (in which these  two cysteines are adjacent). The structural similarities,  chromosomal location, and overall specificity for different  leukocyte populations concur in these families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Baggiolini  et al., 1994</xref>). Two exceptions to the CC/CXC classification  rule are as follows: lymphotactin, a chemokine lacking one  of the two conserved cysteines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Kelner et al., 1994</xref>); and  fractalkine, an integral membrane protein with a chemokine domain in its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Bazan et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>RANTES is a CC chemokine, and interacts with several  chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Rollins, 1997</xref>). It is a potent chemoattractant for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes, as well as for monocytes, NK  cells, and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Schall et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Taub et al., 1995</xref>;  Ugoccioni et al., 1995). RANTES can prevent infection  by macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Cocchi et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Alkhatib et al., 1996</xref>), and its overexpression has been  demonstrated in various chronic pathologies. For example,  in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, RANTES  overexpression is followed by the appearance of infiltrating cells in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Godiska et al.,  1995</xref>). Furthermore, in asthmalike inflammation models,  T cell and eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of sensitized mice are associated with RANTES and eotaxin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Gonzalo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Jia et al., 1996</xref>). Due to the  possible relevance of this chemokine in diverse pathologies, therapy based on administration of chemokine receptor antagonists is a strategy for many of these diseases  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Baggiolini and Moser, 1997</xref>). Hence, RANTES derivatives have been developed that lack chemotactic and  leukocyte-activating properties, and act as functional antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Simmons et al., 1997</xref>). This is the case for  (AOP)-RANTES, a RANTES analogue lacking the first  eight NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Arenzana-Seisdedos et  al., 1996</xref>). This analogue binds to several CC chemokine  receptors (CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5), but does not  induce chemotaxis or enzyme release, thus acting as a  RANTES antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Gong et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, (AOP)- RANTES is a potent inhibitor of macrophage-tropic HIV-1  strains that use CCR5 as a coreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Arenzana-Seisdedos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Simmons et al., 1997</xref>). (AOP)-RANTES  drives the internalization of CCR5 in recombinant cell  lines and in primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Chemokines activate leukocytes through interaction  with single-chain seven transmembrane G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCR)<sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Murphy, 1994</xref>) that are grouped  in two families: CC and CXC receptors, depending on the  chemokines they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Murphy, 1994</xref>). To date, nine CC  and five CXC receptors have been reported, as have orphan receptors whose ligands remain to be elucidated. The  extracellular loops of these receptors act in concert to bind  the chemokine ligand, whereas different intracellular regions are involved in transducing the chemokine signal.  Chemokine receptors are generally coupled to G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Bokoch, 1995</xref>), rendering cellular responses pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive, although there are several examples  of chemokine receptors that couple to both PTX-insensitive or -sensitive G proteins, as is the case of the C5a receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Amatruda et al., 1993</xref>). Ligand binding triggers a  number of biochemical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Ward et al., 1998</xref>) that  lead to changes in intracellular cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmed et  al., 1995</xref>); phospholipase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Bacon et al., 1995a</xref>);  increases in tyrosine phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Bacon et al., 1995b</xref>),  including the Src substrates focal adhesion kinase (FAK)  (p<sup>125</sup> FAK) and ZAP-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>); increased association of Src family kinases with p<sup>21</sup>ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Worthen et al.,  1994</xref>); and MAPK cascade activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Jones et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Ganju et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that the initiation of  chemokine signaling through the CCR2 chemokine receptor involves ligand-triggered receptor association to members of the Janus associated kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Mellado et al., 1998</xref>), as is the case for the  cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">O'Shea, 1997</xref>). Thus, MCP-1 association to the CCR2 chemokine receptor induces CCR2  dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Frade et al., 1999</xref>) and activation  of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Mellado et al.,  1998</xref>). RANTES and other chemokines implicated in regulating T cell functions, such as MIP-1&#x003b1;, also rapidly activate some of the STAT family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wong  and Fish, 1998</xref>), suggesting similar dimerization-triggered  responses.</p><p>Here we analyze early RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES-activated signaling events following binding to CCR5.  Both RANTES and its modified form, (AOP)-RANTES,  trigger tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the  JAK1/STAT5 pathway as well as promoting dimerization  and tyrosine phosphorylation of the CCR5 receptor. While  both promote Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx, only RANTES induces sustained cell polarization and chemotaxis, indicating the activation of different signaling events. These data indicate  that JAK/STAT pathway activation is a general mechanism for chemokine receptor activity and suggest that receptor dimerization and internalization may be key features in chemokine-induced signaling.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Biological Materials</title><p>HEK-293 cells (ATCC TIB202) were obtained from the American Type  Culture Collection, and CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells were kindly donated by Dr. J.

However,  only RANTES triggers migration in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B).  PTX treatment abrogates both calcium release and cell  migration in response to RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A), whereas no effect was observed following incubation with cholera toxin (not shown). This is consistent  with other studies showing that RANTES downstream signals in other cell lines and T cells are coupled to PTX-sensitive G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Bacon et al., 1995b</xref>), and with coupling  of other chemokine receptors to G<sub>i</sub> in transfected HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Aragay et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Mellado et al., 1998</xref>), indicating the utility of this cell line in the study of signaling  through GPCR. </p><p>We have described the ability of RANTES to polarize  peripheral blood T cells, such that the CCR5 receptor migrates to the cell's leading edge while the ICAM-1, ICAM-3/ CD43, CD44 molecules localize at the uropod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Nieto et al.,  1997</xref>). Therefore, we tested the ability of both of these  ligands to induce polarization in peripheral T cell blasts.  Time-course studies of ICAM-3 redistribution to the cell  uropod of FN-adhered T lymphoblasts showed that RANTES  induced ICAM-3 redistribution in a significant proportion  of the cells as early as 15 min after stimulation. Maximum redistribution, seen at 30 min, persisted until at least  90 min of incubation with the chemokine. In contrast,  (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013;induced ICAM-3 polarization showed  a much slower, weaker response, with a peak at 30 min  that vanished thereafter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). </p><p>We next studied the effects of these ligands on the polarization of CCR5 to the advancing front of migrating T  lymphoblasts, a phenomenon that may be involved in the  chemotaxis mechanism.

The downregulation of the (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013; triggered chemokine receptor results in a net inhibition of  CCR5 redistribution to the leading edge of T lymphoblasts  stimulated with this chemokine derivative, compared to  those treated with RANTES (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C). This concurs with  previous observations showing that (AOP)-RANTES induces CCR5 downregulation by blocking receptor recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES Induce Tyrosine  Phosphorylation of the CCR5 Receptor and Association  of the JAK1/STAT5 Complex</title><p>When CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated  with RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES, a 38-kD protein  phosphorylated in tyrosine residues was initially identified  as the CCR5 receptor by immunoblot (not shown).

An increase in  CCR5 receptor phosphorylation in tyrosines is seen as  early as 60 s after stimulation. At this time no differences  were observed following treatment with either stimulus,  indicating that (AOP)-RANTES not only binds to CCR5,  but also signals through this receptor. The early, weak tyrosine phosphorylation level may occur because only one  tyrosine (Tyr 126 in the DRY motif) was being phosphorylated, analogous to the case of Tyr 139 in the CCR2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Mellado et al., 1998</xref>). Similar results are observed in  the inverse experiment, in which anti-PTyr antibody  immunoprecipitates are analyzed in Western blot with  anti-CCR5 receptor antibody (not shown). Again, tyrosine  phosphorylation is detected in CCR5 after stimulation  with either RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES. Nevertheless,  significant differences are observed in tyrosine phosphorylated CCR5 after longer stimulation periods. Whereas  CCR5 phosphorylation persists in RANTES-treated cells  after 15 min of treatment, this is not the case after (AOP)- RANTES stimulation, reinforcing the observation that  there are differences in the signaling pathways activated  by these chemokines. </p><p>To ascertain which kinase is responsible for the rapid  CCR5 chemokine receptor phosphorylation, CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated with RANTES or  (AOP)-RANTES, and cell lysates immunoprecipitated  with anti-CCR5, or with anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin as an isotype-matched antibody control. The use of a specific anti-JAK1 antibody identified a 130-kD protein in the anti-CCR5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). Furthermore, the  JAK1 tyrosine kinase is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after stimulation with either ligand, since anti-PTyr  immunoprecipitates can be developed with anti-JAK1 antibodies in Western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). JAK1 association to  the CCR5 receptor takes place as early as 30 s after  RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A).  Small amounts of JAK1 were also found associated to the  CCR5 receptor in the absence of added ligand, consistent  with receptor phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous ligand in CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, A  and B). </p><p>Neither immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with isotype- matched control antibodies to other cell proteins such as  &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin nor immunoprecipitation in mock-transfected HEK-293 cells (not shown) revealed the presence  of JAK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A). This rules out nonspecific protein association to membrane components under these experimental conditions. The rapid association of JAK1 to the  CCR5 receptor triggered by these two chemokines, but  not by others tested (MCP-1 and SDF-1&#x003b1;), suggests a role  for this tyrosine kinase in early receptor phosphorylation  following ligand stimulation. Interestingly, while MCP-1  promotes JAK2 association to the receptor in CCR2-transfected HEK-293 cells, neither JAK2 nor JAK3 associates to CCR5 after RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES activation of CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells (data not shown).</p><p>To identify the downstream signaling pathway activated  by the JAK1 kinase, we tested its association to members  of the STAT transcription factor family. We analyzed  JAK1 kinase-activated STAT transcription factors in anti-CCR5 immunoprecipitates, and found that STAT5 associates to the receptor complex in response to both ligands  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C). The association of STAT5 correlates in time  with JAK1 phosphorylation and binding. Furthermore,  the precipitated STAT5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, showing it is in the activated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> D). Immunoprecipitates of RANTES-stimulated cell lysates with  isotype-matched control antibodies do not contain STAT5.  These results were further validated by the reverse experiments, in which anti-STAT5 antibodies were used for  immunoprecipitation and Western blots developed with  either anti-PTyr or anti-CCR5 antibodies (not shown).  Therefore, binding of both RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES  to the CCR5 receptor induces receptor and JAK1 phosphorylation and STAT5 binding. Independent of the fact  that other STAT transcriptional factors may be implicated  in CCR5-mediated signaling, our data show that no major  differences are observed in RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES  activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES Induce CCR5 Dimerization</title><p>Similar to growth factor&#x02013;induced dimerization of tyrosine  kinase receptors, some GPCR, including chemokine receptors like CCR2 and CXCR4, undergo ligand-induced  dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Hebert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Frade et  al., 1999</xref>; Vila-Coro, A.J., J.M. Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Frade, A.  Mart&#x000ed;n de Ana, M.C. Moreno-Ortiz, C. Mart&#x000ed;nez-A., and  M. Mellado, manuscript submitted for publication). We  have now tested whether RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES  trigger CCR5 dimerization. DSS-mediated cross-linking in  CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells was carried out after  RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES stimulation. In CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells, but not in mock-transfected  cells, a high molecular mass receptor species (76 kD) was  observed following both stimuli. This band corresponds to  the expected molecular mass of two CCR5 molecules, as  assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CCR5 antibodies and Western blot developed with anti-CCR5 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). When CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells  were stimulated with SDF-1&#x003b1;, no CCR5 dimerization was  observed under these experimental conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A),  despite the fact that HEK-293 cells express a functional  CXCR4 receptor as determined by flow cytometry and  SDF-1&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced calcium mobilization assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B).  When the same experiment was done using anti-CXCR4  mAb for immunoprecipitation and Western blot, a high  molecular mass species (84 kD) of the CXCR4 receptor is  observed only after SDF-1&#x003b1;, but not after RANTES or  (AOP)-RANTES stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). </p><p>All together, these data indicate specific ligand-induced  dimerization, as SDF-1&#x003b1; is not able to induce CCR5  dimerization, while RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES are not  able to induce CXCR4 dimers. In addition, association of  CCR5 with other membrane components, including other  chemokine receptors, can be discarded under these experimental conditions, as cells treated with SDF-1&#x003b1; render  only CXCR4 dimers, and those treated with RANTES and  (AOP)-RANTES render only CCR5 dimers. High molecular mass species containing CCR5 and CXCR4 simultaneously are not detected, as shown when cells are stimulated with SDF-1&#x003b1; or RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES,  and when immunoprecipitation and Western blot are performed using anti-CCR5 or anti-CXCR4 antibodies, respectively. Both RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES, like  other chemokines and similar to members of the large cytokine family, can trigger early signaling events such as receptor dimerization, followed by recruitment of tyrosine  kinases that phosphorylate both the receptor and the  STAT transcription factors.</p></sec><sec><title>G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> and p<sup>125</sup>FAK Association to CCR5 Differ after  RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES Stimulation</title><p>The PTX dependence of RANTES- and (AOP)- RANTES&#x02013;triggered Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization indicates G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> involvement in this process. It has been demonstrated recently that chemokine receptor&#x02013;mediated chemotaxis is  triggered by the &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit of G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Neptune and Bourne,  1997</xref>). In MCP-1&#x02013;mediated chemotaxis, we have shown  that G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> associates rapidly to the CCR2 receptor, releasing &#x003b2;&#x003b3;, which is responsible for activating migration and  cell polarization. Thus, we investigated whether the differences in chemotaxis triggering reflect differences in  RANTES- and (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013;mediated G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub>-CCR5  receptor association.</p><p>CCR5- or mock-transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated with RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES, immunoprecipitated with anti-CCR5 or isotype-matched control  antibodies, followed by a Western blot with anti-G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> antibodies. After both RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES stimulation, G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> associated to CCR5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). Whereas association persisted for longer than 15 min when cells were  RANTES-stimulated, G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> is dissociated from the receptor  after 5 min of (AOP)-RANTES treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). The  CCR5 expression level was controlled in both immunoprecipitates by stripping and reblotting membranes with anti-CCR5 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A). These data concur with the  similar Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization promoted by both of these  ligands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A), as G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> association to CCR5 is unaltered  at the times employed for these experiments (1&#x02013;3 min).  Rapid G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> dissociation from the CCR5, induced only by  (AOP)-RANTES, implies a role for G<sub>i</sub> in later chemokine-triggered events such as chemotaxis. This result concurs with data showing the importance of &#x003b2;&#x003b3; release from  G<sub>i</sub> in chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Neptune and Bourne, 1997</xref>). </p><p>The activation of p<sup>125</sup>FAK and the kinase ZAP-70 has  been described in T cells after RANTES activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether p<sup>125</sup>FAK  activation coincides with its association to the CCR5.  CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells were stimulated with  10 nM RANTES or (AOP)-RANTES, cell lysates were  immunoprecipitated with anti-p<sup>125</sup>FAK or an isotype-matched control antibody and analyzed in Western blot  for the presence of CCR5. RANTES, but not (AOP)- RANTES, promotes the association of this kinase to the  receptor, reaching maximum binding after 15 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>  B). Even in the absence of ligand, residual association  between these two proteins was observed. The lack of  p<sup>125</sup>FAK association and the rapid G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> dissociation from  the CCR5 receptor in the case of (AOP)-RANTES suggest that association of these proteins with the receptor is  crucial in triggering the signaling pathways that lead to the  different effects promoted by these two chemokines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Interest is rapidly growing in a broad view of the chemokine function, not only because of significance in HIV infection, but also because chemokines and their receptors  are expressed by a wide variety of nonhematopoietic cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Horuk et al., 1997</xref>). Because of the relevance of chemokines in numerous pathologies, it appears of the utmost  importance to devise therapies based on the administration of chemokines that lack chemotactic and leukocyte-activating properties, but are able to act as receptor  antagonists. These are the basic characteristics of (AOP)- RANTES, a RANTES analogue that has been chemically  modified at its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus, although very little is known  of the mechanism underlying its action.</p><p>We have generated anti-CCR5 mAbs and used them to  characterize the signaling pathways activated by RANTES  and (AOP)-RANTES. The results show that ligand-induced CCR5 dimerization occurs when these chemokines signal target cells for activation. In the response to  cytokines, receptor dimerization triggers a pathway involving tyrosine kinases and transcriptional factors. Only  the JAK1 tyrosine kinase responds to RANTES and to  (AOP)-RANTES by rapidly associating to CCR5 and is  phosphorylated as soon as 30 s after binding, indicating  that JAK1 activation is virtually simultaneous with its association to CCR5. In the cytokine receptors, activation  and association of JAK kinase to the receptor creates  docking sites for SH2-containing proteins such as STAT,  leading to their phosphorylation, followed by activation of  gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Ihle, 1996</xref>). After binding of either of  the chemokine ligands studied here, STAT5 is also associated to the CCR5, in accordance with the role of the JAK  kinases in transducing signals from hematopoietic growth  factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">O'Shea, 1997</xref>). Our data concur with a  recent report showing rapid activation of certain STAT  transcription factors in T cells after RANTES and MIP-1&#x003b1;  stimulation, although in that case association to the CCR5  receptor was not analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wong and Fish, 1998</xref>). Together, these results indicate that chemokine-mediated activation of GPCR leads to signal transduction, which invokes intracellular phosphorylation intermediates used by  other cytokine receptors. These earlier events are equally  activated by both RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES.</p><p>Both RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES induce CCR5  dimerization, a phenomenon that requires specific interaction between a given chemokine and its respective receptor. When experiments were performed using SDF-1&#x003b1; as  a ligand neither CCR5 dimers nor CCR5-CXCR4 heterodimers were observed, whereas CXCR4 dimers are  present in anti-CXCR4 immunoprecipitates. Direct interaction between two CCR5 molecules has also been demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Benkirane et al. (1997)</xref>, even in the absence  of ligand stimulation. The functional significance of dimerization was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Hebert et al. (1996)</xref> using the  epitope tagging approach, showing that agonist stimulation of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor stabilized the dimeric  state of the receptor. The present data indicate that although dimerization is a primary event following ligand  interaction with the chemokine receptor, it does not  necessarily initiate identical transduction events. (AOP)- RANTES thus triggers Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization as does RANTES,  but promotes neither cell migration nor CCR5 redistribution to the leading edge in cell polarization. The rapid G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub>  association to CCR5 induced by both ligands explains the  similar Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization response and lack of response in  PTX-pretreated cells.</p><p>It has been shown for a number of GPCR that different  ligands of a given receptor can induce different responses.  This is the case for CXCR2, from which IL-8 and NAP-2  elicit different responses, although they bind with equivalent affinity to this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Ben-Baruch et al., 1997</xref>). It is  feasible that RANTES and (AOP)-RANTES induce distinct conformational changes in the CCR5. In fact, it has  been shown that different structural requirements are  needed in GPCR to activate different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Hunyady  et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Arai et al., 1997a</xref>). In the case of angiotensin II  receptor changes have been described in internalization  kinetics that do not alter other functional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Hunyady et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Whereas G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> association to CCR5 persists as long as 15  min after RANTES treatment, it dissociates from CCR5  by 5 min after (AOP)-RANTES stimulation. This variance  must give rise to a clear difference in the availability of  free, active &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits by affecting some ligand-induced  responses. In fact, G<sub>i</sub> &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit release is known to be  important in chemokine receptor&#x02013;mediated chemotaxis  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Arai et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Neptune and Bourne, 1997</xref>). Another  conspicuous difference is the lack of late tyrosine phosphorylation in CCR5 after (AOP)-RANTES treatment, in  contrast to the continuous tyrosine phosphorylation of  CCR5 observed following RANTES induction. This may  occur because of tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by  other tyrosine kinases. The activation of both p<sup>125</sup>FAK  and ZAP-70 has been described after RANTES stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Bacon et al., 1996</xref>). Here we demonstrate association  of p<sup>125</sup>FAK, which is related to cytoskeletal proteins and  migration phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Sieg et al., 1998</xref>), to the receptor  following RANTES but not (AOP)-RANTES stimulation.  The failure of (AOP)-RANTES to maintain G<sub>i</sub> association  for long (15 min) periods concurs with the lack of association and activation of p<sup>125</sup>FAK and the inactivation of subsequent events. Both activation of G<sub>i</sub> and p<sup>125</sup>FAK, as well  as chemotaxis, occur after RANTES activation, but are  absent when cells were treated with (AOP)-RANTES, indicating a possible relationship between these events.</p><p>Chemotaxis involves several phenomena including:  changes in cell shape, integrin affinity, and integrin recycling at the cell's leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Condeelis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Lawson  and Maxfield, 1995</xref>). These events appear to be mediated  by G protein activation, as well as phosphorylation signals  through chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Bokoch, 1995</xref>). In fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, the regulation of intracellular FAK and its interaction with the cytoskeletal proteins &#x003b1;-actinin, talin, and vinculin have also been given  much attention with respect to cell polarization and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Clark and Brugge, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Miyamoto et al., 1995</xref>). As a  consequence of RANTES stimulation, T cells undergo a  polarization process in which the CCR5 receptor redistributes to the leading cell edge and p<sup>125</sup>FAK associates to the  receptor. Both events, implicated in the late response to  chemokines, are required for chemotaxis and are triggered  by RANTES. Early (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013;induced signaling  events, such as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> mobilization, result in weak, transient  cell polarization, and redistribution of the ICAM-3 adhesion receptor to the T lymphocyte uropod. This antagonist  does not mediate cellular chemotaxis. Recycling of CCR5  molecules to the cell membrane, which probably occurs at  the advancing front of the cell and is inhibited by (AOP)- RANTES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack et al., 1998</xref>), appears to be critical for the  mechanism of directional cell migration towards a chemokine gradient. This is further supported by our data showing the failure of CCR5 to cluster at the leading edge of  (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013;stimulated cells. Therefore, these results suggest that during the chemotaxis process early signals induced by chemokines through receptor dimerization may not be sufficient to induce cell migration. Signals  triggered by sustained association of the G protein to the  chemokine receptor may also regulate other events necessary for the chemotactic response, such as integrin affinity  or actin polymerization at the leading cell edge. Our data  also support the idea that p<sup>125</sup>FAK kinase association to  the receptor is not involved in ligand-induced CCR5  internalization, since (AOP)-RANTES is as efficient as  RANTES in promoting internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack et al., 1998</xref>),  without inducing p<sup>125</sup>FAK association.</p><p>The data presented here can be incorporated in a model  in which signaling through chemokine receptors directly  involves early signals that occur in the first few minutes after ligand binding, including receptor dimerization; association and activation of JAK tyrosine kinases, and activation of STAT transcriptional factors, as well as late signals  such as cell polarization, activation, and association of  p<sup>125</sup>FAK kinase to the chemokine receptor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The  fact that chemokine receptors activate the JAK/STAT  pathway and that dimerization may be a general mechanism for chemokine activity adds a new perspective to understanding how the multiplicity of chemokine functions  are achieved. Furthermore, it suggests an interesting new  objective for therapeutic intervention in chemokine-associated pathologies, including inflammation and AIDS. </p><p>Internalization of chemokine receptors is a phenomenon that can be dissociated from their role as HIV-1 coreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Aramori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Howard et al., 1998</xref>). Although the ability of the coreceptor to internalize is not  required for HIV entry, it contributes to the HIV suppressive effect of CC and CXC chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Amara et al.,  1997</xref>). (AOP)-RANTES is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity, an effect that is suggested because it enhanced  CCR5 internalization and inhibition of recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack  et al., 1998</xref>). As internalization is an agonist-driven event,  (AOP)-RANTES as well as other NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal modified  chemokines should be able to activate their receptors. The  differences between RANTES- and (AOP)-RANTES&#x02013; induced internalization may be related to increased affinity of (AOP)-RANTES for the CCR5 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mack et  al., 1998</xref>), although differences in the signaling pathways  activated by these two ligands have not been reported.  Here we correlate the known effects of (AOP)-RANTES  with a signaling cascade and suggest that the dimerization  of chemokine receptors is an alternative mechanism for  chemokine-induced HIV-1 inhibition.</p><p>Receptor dimerization is also the mechanism through  which antibodies to the CCR2 NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal domain block  HIV-1 infection. In fact, the anti-CCR2 mAb CCR2-01  that blocks HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Frade et al., 1997b</xref>), but not  MCP-1&#x02013;induced responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Frade et al., 1997a</xref>), triggers  CCR2 dimerization (Mellado, M., manuscript in preparation). The concept that receptor dimerization is required  for prevention of HIV-1 infection, besides including the  nonsignaling mechanism indicated by (AOP)-RANTES,  incorporates the model based on receptor internalization,  which does not take place in the absence of dimerization.  For both receptor desensitization and internalization, we  have shown the requirement for GRK2 association and  phosphorylation in serine/threonine residues of the COOH- terminal receptor domain. This in turn associates with  arrestin and clathrin, and undergoes internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Aragay  et al., 1998</xref>). Dimerization is a necessary event for the formation of the receptor/GRK-2/arrestin/clathrin complex.  This model consolidates all available experimental evidence, and offers novel prospects for screening new drugs  that may prevent HIV-1 infection and/or inflammatory  processes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CCR5-01, -02, and -03 antibodies are specific for the  CCR5 chemokine receptor. mAb specificity for the CCR5 receptor was assessed by flow cytometry analysis of mock- and CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cells.

(D) Cells as in C were immunoprecipitated with anti-PTyr antibody and analyzed in Western blot with anti-STAT5 antibody. Protein loading was carefully controlled using a  protein detection kit as above. The figure shows control RANTES-stimulated (10 nM) CCR5-transfected HEK-293 cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti&#x02013;MHC class I mAb and analyzed with anti-STAT5 antibodies.

Cell lysates  were immunoprecipitated with mAb CCR5-03, electrophoresed,  and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.

This lower response correlates with the lower amounts of dimerized CXCR4 receptor,  and explains the longer exposure time required to develop the  Western blot for the dimerized receptor.
