Tumor immunity is often mediated  by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) whose activation is supported by Th1 cytokines. Since IL-4  directs Th2 development and has been shown to inhibit Th1-dominated responses, we assumed that IL-4&#x02013;deficient (IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup>) mice would develop vigorous CTL-mediated tumor immunity compared with IL-4&#x02013;competent (IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup>) mice. Surprisingly, IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice were severely impaired to develop tumor immunity to both a mammary adenocarcinoma line and a  colon carcinoma line. The lack of tumor immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated with reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production, diminished levels of tumor-reactive serum IgG2a, and undetectable  CTL activity, indicating a defective Th1 response in the absence of endogenous IL-4. Anti&#x02013;IL-4  monoclonal antibody blocked tumor immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> mice when administered at the time  of immunization but not at the time of challenge. Additionally, tumor immunity could be induced in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice, if IL-4 was provided by gene-modified cells together with immunizing  tumor cells. These results demonstrate that tumor immunity requires IL-4 in the priming phase  for the generation of effector cells rather than for their maintenance and exclude secondary, developmental defects in the &#x0201c;knockout&#x0201d; strain. Together, our results demonstrate a novel and  previously unanticipated role of IL-4 for the generation of Th1-associated, CTL-mediated tumor immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tumor vaccination</kwd><kwd>interleukin 4</kwd><kwd>T cell immunity</kwd><kwd>interleukin 4&#x02013;deficient  mice</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Most experimental tumors and probably many human  tumors express antigens against which an immune  response can be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In mice it has been shown  clearly that such antigens can serve as rejection antigens, if  the mice are immunized with tumor cells in an immunogenic, nontumorigenic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) or with tumor antigens  themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and subsequently challenged with a tumorigenic dose of that tumor. Recent results from different  groups have shown that tumor immunogenicity is defined  operationally rather than absolutely and that it can be enhanced in various ways. Tumor immunity can be induced,  at least in some models, by tumor cells engineered to express certain cytokines or the T cell costimulatory molecule  B7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) or, more simply, by the use of adjuvants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), repeated immunizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), or with larger numbers of tumor  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The cellular requirements for induction of tumor  immunity seem to be quite similar regardless of the type of  immunization. Rejection of MHC class I<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, class II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> tumors  (like the ones used in this study) often requires CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  CTLs whose activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and in some models maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), depends on help by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. To provide  help, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells must first be activated, which requires  tumor-derived antigens to be taken up, processed, and presented by an MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> APC. The fact that activation  of CTLs specific to minor H antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) or surrogate tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) similarly depends on host APCs suggests that the same APC presents antigens to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The close proximity of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells recognizing antigens on the same APC would be  compatible with the assumption that help by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells occurs by providing cytokines that are supposed to act on a short distance, e.g., in the same lymph  node. However, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell help for CTL generation  must not necessarily consist in cytokine supply. Recently, it  has been demonstrated that signaling through CD40 on  APCs can replace the requirement for CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells during  CTL generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell lines can be divided into two subpopulations, Th1 and Th2, based on the profile of secreted cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Th1 cells predominantly produce IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3;  and are associated with cellular immune responses such as  delayed hypersensitivity or differentiation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  into CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). They also induce class switch in B cells to  IgG2a. Th2 cells preferentially produce cytokines such as  IL-4 and IL-10, and are associated with a humoral immune  response, e.g., inducing class switch to IgE and IgG1. Th1  and Th2 cells have been implicated in different models of  infectious disease or autoimmunity with disease susceptibility or protection, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). IFN-&#x003b3; production by  Th1 cells inhibits the maturation of Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Conversely, IL-4 production by Th2 cells suppresses the generation of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). It is important to note that the  cross-inhibitory effects of IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; have been demonstrated mainly in vitro or in the late phase of the immune response to chronic antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The decision whether an immune response is directed to Th1 or  Th2 seems to depend on a number of variables (e.g., nature  of the antigen, amount of antigen, type of APC, local cytokine milieu, and mouse strain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>); however, it appears  to be made rapidly. Thus, antigen-specific IgG2a or IgG1  can be detected within 5 d of immunization in a Th1- or  Th2-inducing fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The cytokine requirements for  induction of the Th1 pathway in the early phase are not  completely understood. However, a few reports have challenged the assumption of a simple inverse relationship between IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; production in vivo. Transgenic animals constitutively overexpressing small amounts of IL-4  have elevated, not decreased, IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In  an in vitro rat model of activated T cell blasts, IL-4&#x02013;stimulated IFN-&#x003b3; synthesis early in the culture but inhibited the  development of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Kamogawa  et al. showed, in a transgenic mouse model that allowed  ablation of IL-4 producing cells, that IFN-&#x003b3; producing  cells were also concomitantly deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The interpretation was that Th1 and Th2 cells were derived from a common precursor. The question whether early IL-4 expression is required for the generation of Th1 cells could not be  addressed with these mice. Using BALB/c IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice  along with IL-4 reconstitution experiments, we show that  the absence of IL-4 in the priming phase results in disabled  Th1 generation and CTL development and defective tumor immunity.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>BALB/c mice were purchased from Bomholtgaard  Breeding &#x00026; Research Centre, Denmark. IL-4-deficient mice (IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup>) were generated by targeted disruption of the IL-4 gene in  embryonic stem cells derived from BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and produced in a manner such that they can be considered IL-4&#x02013;congenic to BALB/c. The deficiency of the IL-4 gene was confirmed by PCR of tail DNA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). All  mice used in the experiments were 6&#x02013;12-wk-old and were sex  matched.

To titrate the number  of immunizing cells capable of inducing tumor immunity  against the mammary adenocarcinoma TS/A, IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> and  IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice were immunized with increasing numbers of  irradiated cells. 2 wk later, the mice were challenged with a  constant number of TS/A cells sufficient to give rise to tumors in 100% of naive mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, a&#x02013;c). At the lowest immunization dose, 100% of IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> and IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice developed tumors. With increasing vaccination doses, IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup>  mice rejected the challenge tumor, whereas IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice  were consistently less protected. These results were confirmed with a second tumor (CT-26; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, d&#x02013;f). 100% of  challenge tumors grew in mice of both genotypes after immunization with the lowest cell number of CT-26. Increasing immunization doses induced protection in the majority of IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> mice, whereas almost all IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice  were unable to reject the challenge tumor. The defect of  IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice to reject the challenge tumor was not due to  generally enhanced tumor growth, because TS/A and CT-26 cells grew with similar kinetics in naive IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> and IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

To  find whether the defective tumor immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup>  mice was associated with reduced CTL activities, IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup>  and IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice were immunized with CT-26 cells and  tumor-specific lysis was measured.

Cytolytic activity against the NK target YAC-1 was negligible  in spleen cells from both mouse strains, suggesting that lysis  of CT-26 by IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs was specific. Additionally, immunization with &#x003b2;-galactosidase&#x02013;expressing TS/A cells resulted in clearly reduced &#x003b2;-galactosidase-specific CTL-activity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice (data not shown). </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Tumor Immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> Mice Is Associated with a Th1  Response.</title><p>Changes in serum Ig isotype levels are an indication for ongoing Th1 or Th2 responses in vivo.

Amounts of IgE and IgG1 remained largely unaltered,  whereas IgG2a was significantly increased. To detect IgG2a  antibodies reacting with tumor cells, CT-26 cells were  stained with the same sera and the binding efficiency was  measured by FACS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> analysis.

These results indicate a reduced IFN-&#x003b3;  production upon immunization in the absence of endogenous IL-4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

After immunization and challenge  with TS/A cells, 50% of control mice but none of the animals treated with the anti&#x02013;IL-4 mAb during the immunization phase rejected the challenge tumor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). IL-4 neutralization during the challenge phase did not impair tumor  rejection. In fact, fewer mice developed a challenge tumor,  the significance of which is not clear. These data indicate  that memory effector cells do not require IL-4 to exert  their tumoricidal activity, although their development is  dependent on early IL-4 production. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Exogenous IL-4 Restores Tumor Immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> Mice.</title><p>The data presented thus far do not clearly exclude that  unknown developmental defects in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice, such as  reduced precursor frequencies of potential tumor reactive  lymphocytes, rather than the absence of IL-4 during the  priming phase, diminished vaccination efficiencies. To address this, IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice were immunized with different  doses of CT-26 cells mixed with 10<sup>6</sup> IL-4&#x02013;secreting NIH-3T3-IL-4 cells. As controls, IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice were injected  with identical doses of CT-26 and parental, non-IL-4-secreting NIH-3T3. 2 wk later, mice were challenged  with CT-26 cells and tumor incidence was measured. Depending on the number of CT-26 cells used for immunization, 40&#x02013;70% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, a and b, respectively) of mice developed protective tumor immunity after immunization in the  presence of exogenous IL-4, whereas none of the control  animals was protected. These results show that tumor immunity can be induced in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice, as long as IL-4 is  provided during the immunization phase. As demonstrated  for IL-4<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), protection efficiency in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup>  mice could also be modulated by the amount of antigen  used for immunization. Therefore, these experiments suggest that IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> lymphocytes are functionally intact and  emphasize the necessity of IL-4 during the T cell priming  stage for the induction of tumor immunity. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice have a severe defect  in the development of tumor immunity. Furthermore, the  absence of tumor immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice was associated  with the absence of a Th1 response to the tumor as shown  by reduced serum IgG2a levels and IFN-&#x003b3; production. In  addition, we showed that IL-4 was required for the induction but not for the maintenance of tumor immunity. To  understand this unexpected role of IL-4, the sequence of  events leading to tumor immunity needs to be considered.  Antigens derived from the immunizing tumor cells which  are MHC class I<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/II<sup>&#x02212;</sup> must be taken up and processed by  host APCs and presented by MHC class I and class II molecules to CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, respectively. Because  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are critical for the development of tumor immunity, the initial event is the activation of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells,  which provide help for activation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).  Like IL-4, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are necessary in the priming  phase. In the TS/A model, we have shown previously that  once CTLs have been generated, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell depletion  (at the time of challenge) did not impair CTL mediated tumor rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that the defective  CTL response in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice is the result of defective  help by Th1 cells. This help has been explained previously  by providing cytokines to CTLs, probably Th1 cytokines  like IL-2 or IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Recently, however, it has been  shown that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell help for CTL activation does not  consist of a direct interaction between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells but rather by activation of APCs, perhaps dendritic  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The cross-talk between CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and  APCs is mediated by CD40&#x02013;CD40 ligand interaction and  T cell help for CTL generation can be replaced by in vivo  application of an agonistic antibody that acts on APCs  other than B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This mechanism not only obviates  the need of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to meet each other at  the same APC but also the need of Th1 cytokines for CTL  generation. It is possible that a similar mechanism is operative in our tumor models, a possibility that is supported by  the finding that IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice can mount an undiminished  CTL response to some viral antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), which at least  partially occurs independently of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Th1-independent CTL responses to viral antigens correlate with the observation that viruses can directly infect  dendritic cells. Therefore, at the present time we cannot  distinguish whether IL-4 (which is produced for a short period under Th1-polarizing conditions, see below) acts on  the APC or the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, or directly contributes to  CTL generation during priming.</p><p>Although our results apparently contradict the Th1/Th2  paradigm, they do not if the time of IL-4 activity that is required for development of a Th1 response is considered.  The inhibitory effect of IL-4 on Th1 development has  been most clearly observed in vitro under conditions of  prolonged addition of exogenous IL-4 or in vivo under  conditions of chronic antigen exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our results do  not exclude the possibility that IL-4 has opposing effects in  later stages of an antitumor response, e.g., in tumor-bearing  animals. However, the fact that the development of a Th1  response and concomitant tumor immunity requires IL-4 at  the time of immunization only (when T cell priming  should happen) is reminiscent to the finding that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells cultured under Th1-polarizing conditions express IL-4  for the first 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Also, the artificial expression of IL-4,  either by tumor cells transfected to secrete IL-4 or in a  transgenic mouse model, leads to induction of IFN-&#x003b3; in  vivo, in both T cell&#x02013;competent and &#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The importance of IFN-&#x003b3; for the development of  T cell&#x02013;dependent tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) and for tumor  growth inhibition of IL-4&#x02013;secreting tumors has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup>  mice are impaired to resolve <italic>Candida albicans</italic> in the late  stage of infection, which has been explained by the missing  IL-4 to induce neutrophils for IL-12 production and subsequent Th1 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). The fact that the induction  of an antitumor response induced by tumor cell&#x02013;produced  IL-4 is critically dependent on neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) raises the  possibility that a similar mechanism is operating during the  generation of tumor immunity, although CTLs to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> had not been measured.</p><p>The immunogenicity of tumor cells depends on a number of factors related to the host, e.g., the inhibitory effect  of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), or to the tumor, e.g., the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) or the amount of tumor  cells used for immunization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The failure to induce  tumor immunity with low numbers of tumor cells could  mean that it is simply the limiting amount of tumor- derived antigens available for the appropriate APCs, yet IL-4  is produced in a manner unrelated to the immunizing  tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>), or that a certain number of tumor cells is  required to induce IL-4. We favor the latter assumption,  because Bosco et al. showed in the TS/A tumor model that  in mice challenged with a low number of viable tumor cells  which did not lead to a measurable antitumor response that  tumor immunity could be induced by IL-4 injection  around the tumor-draining lymph node where T cell priming probably occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). IL-4 was injected for a period  of 10 d, which is comparable to the estimated time of  IL-4 production by the NIH-3T3-IL-4 cells, which when  added to the immunizing tumor cells restored tumor immunity in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). It is important to note that  very low amounts of recombinant IL-4 (0.1 pg/d) were  most effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), showing that not only the time point  but also the amount of IL-4 required for induction of tumor immunity is critical. We also show that the lack of IL-4  is not compensated for by other cytokines such as IL-13  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) for the generation of tumor immunity. Our results  are surprising because a number of studies in other experimental models with IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice showed that IL-4 was  not necessary for a normal immune response, e.g., against  parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), or even diminished immune reactions, e.g., in retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). Whether this difference is  due to Th-dependent CTL generation often required for  tumor immunity remains to be established. In conclusion,  our study reveals a novel role of IL-4 for the generation of  tumor immunity that contributes to a better mechanistic  understanding as a rationale for immunotherapy.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Generation of tumor immunity  is impaired in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice.
