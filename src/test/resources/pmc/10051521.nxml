We simulated numerically the stochastic dynamics of RyRs and L-type sarcolemmal calcium channels interacting via calcium nano-domains in the junctional cleft. Four putative RyR gating  schemes based on single-channel measurements in lipid bilayers all failed to give stable excitation&#x02013;contraction coupling, due either to insufficiently strong inactivation to terminate locally regenerative calcium-induced calcium release or insufficient cooperativity to discriminate against RyR activation by background calcium. If the ryanodine  receptor was represented, instead, by a phenomenological four-state gating scheme, with channel opening resulting from simultaneous binding of two Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions, and either calcium-dependent or activation-linked inactivation,  the simulations gave a good semiquantitative accounting for the macroscopic features of excitation&#x02013;contraction  coupling. It was possible to restore stability to a model based on a bilayer-derived gating scheme, by introducing allosteric interactions between nearest-neighbor RyRs so as to stabilize the inactivated state and produce cooperativity among calcium binding sites on different RyRs. Such allosteric coupling between RyRs may be a function of the  foot process and lattice array, explaining their conservation during evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sarcoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>Monte Carlo</kwd><kwd>calcium-induced calcium release</kwd><kwd>dihydropyridine receptor</kwd><kwd>diad junction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Introduction"><title>introduction</title><p>The intracellular signal that triggers the contraction of  cardiac muscle is a transient rise in intracellular free  calcium. The majority of this calcium (50&#x02013;95%, depending upon species and conditions) is released from  the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).<sup>1</sup> This calcium is released by a process of calcium-induced calcium release  (CICR) (Endo et al.<italic>,</italic> 1970; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Fabiato, 1985</xref>) via release  channels, which have been shown to be type-2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2). It is generally believed that the  major stimulus for CICR is calcium entering the cell via  sarcolemmal dihydropyridine&#x02013;sensitive L-type calcium  channels. The rate and amount of calcium release from  the SR is tightly controlled by the magnitude and duration of the L-type calcium current (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">R&#x000ed;os and Stern,  1997</xref>, for a review of the evidence). This graded control  is paradoxical because the released calcium, which is  roughly 10&#x000d7; larger in amount than the trigger, would  be expected to stimulate further CICR, leading to a regenerative, nearly all-or-none release. Several years ago  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Stern, 1992</xref>), we proposed that this paradox of control  might be explained if the stimulus for release of calcium by RyRs were actually the local nanodomains of  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] generated by nearby L-type channels, rather  than the global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]. According to this local  control hypothesis, the graded control of macroscopic  SR calcium release would actually be achieved by  graded statistical recruitment of individual, autonomous, stochastic release events.</p><p>Recent ultrastructural studies (Franzini-Armstrong,  C., F. Protasi, and V. Ramesh, manuscript in preparation) show that, depending on species, from a few tens  to &#x0223c;200 RyRs are clustered in a two dimensional crystal-lattice array on the surface of SR release terminals,  apposed, across the 15-nm cleft of the diad junction, to  clusters of sarcolemmal dihydropyridine receptors  (DHPRs). RyR2 is a homotetramer of a polypeptide of  roughly 5,000 amino acids. The transmembrane calcium-sensitive channel is formed by the COOH-terminal &#x0223c;600 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Tunwell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bhat et al.,  1997a</xref>), while the remainder of the molecule forms a  30-nm quatrefoil &#x0201c;foot process&#x0201d; that spans the diadic  cleft, and is required for interaction of the channel  with a variety of modulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bhat et al., 1997b</xref>). The  DHPRs in cardiac muscle, whose number varies in different studies from 10&#x02013;100% of the number of RyRs  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Wibo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bers and Stiffel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Sun et al.,  1995</xref>), are localized at the junctions, but are randomly  positioned relative to the ryanodine receptor lattice  (Franzini-Armstrong, C., F. Protasi, and V. Ramesh,  manuscript in preparation). This contrasts with the regular arrangement of DHPR tetrads found in skeletal  muscle.</p><p>We carried out numerical simulations of this system  of channels, interacting stochastically via calcium diffusing in the diadic cleft. These simulations have revealed a new paradox. Local control succeeds if the gating of the RyR is represented by a simple, phenomenological, four-state scheme. However, published schemes  derived from actual gating statistics of single RyR2  channels incorporated into lipid bilayers give rise to  unacceptable instabilities when used in the local control model. These instabilities are traceable to two deficiencies in bilayer-derived gating schemes. The absence  of strong inactivation prevents termination of locally  regenerative release by clustered RyRs. Activation by  binding of a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion, in some bilayer-derived  schemes, does not provide adequate discrimination  against activation by global (rather than microdomain)  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. This suggests that the gating of RyR2 in situ may  differ significantly from its behavior in bilayers. One  possible explanation of this difference would be the existence of allosteric interactions between the large foot  processes of adjacent RyRs, which appear anatomically to  be in contact. We show by simulation that RyR&#x02013;RyR allosteric interaction energies can be chosen in such a way  as to remedy both the inactivation and the cooperativity deficiencies of RyR2 gating schemes. Such interactions may be one of the important functions of the foot  process, which has been highly conserved in evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Methods" sec-type="methods"><title>methods</title><sec><title>Simulation</title><p>Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using a modification  of an algorithm previously reported (Stern et al.<italic>,</italic> 1997). In brief,  the set of channels at each diad was treated as a single stochastic  system whose state (&#x0201c;macrostate&#x0201d;) is defined by specifying the  Markov state of each of the individual channels. State transitions  of individual channels are considered to take place instantaneously so that a macrostate transition corresponds to a transition of exactly one channel. The transition rates of the individual  channels were determined from their gating schemes as a function of the local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] at the position of each channel. The  dwell time and destination of each transition were selected by  use of appropriately distributed random numbers, while the local  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] was determined concomitantly by solving the partial differential equations governing diffusion and binding reactions in  the diadic cleft. The aggregate calcium fluxes produced by  1,000&#x02013;10,000 such diads were taken as input to a conventional  lumped-compartment model of global cytosolic and SR calcium  dynamics. This model (a set of ordinary differential equations)  was solved to update the values of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cytosolic</sub> and [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>SR</sub>.  These were used, in turn, to determine unitary currents of the  channels and to set boundary conditions at the edges of the diadic clefts. The global model consisted of seven differential equations governing the following dynamical variables: [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, SR  lumenal calcium (in rapid equilibrium with calsequestrin), and  calcium bound to five types of buffer sites, representing calcium-sensing dye (fluo-3), troponin, calmodulin, SR membrane sites,  and low affinity sarcolemmal sites. The SR calcium pump was  modeled as a steady uptake, represented by a Hill function of  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, balanced (in the resting state) by a leak proportional  to lumenal [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]. Compartmental volumes and the kinetic parameters of all buffers and pumps were taken from the literature  (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>) and were not treated as adjustable parameters of the  model. The details of the cytosolic calcium removal model have very  little effect on the short term simulations presented in this paper. </p><p>The extreme computational demands of such a simulation required the use of approximations to the reaction&#x02013;diffusion equations in the diadic cleft. Because of the large aspect ratio of the  cleft (diameter 100&#x02013;400 nm, height 15 nm), diffusion was treated  in two dimensions only, and the equations were discretized on a  10-nm mesh. This coarse approximation can be justified because  the locations of the exit pore(s) and calcium sensing site(s) of  the ryanodine receptor, as well as the diffusion paths of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  through the space occupied by the RyR foot processes, are not  known with any greater precision. L-type channels were located  at random on the mesh, while RyRs were located regularly at 30-nm  center-to-center spacing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Effective values of the cleft  height and calcium diffusion coefficient were used to approximate the effects of surface charge, viscosity and tortuosity, as estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Soeller and Cannell (1997)</xref>. Diads containing up to 121  RyRs were simulated; most of the results shown here were computed for 25-RyR diads containing an average of five randomly  located DHPRs that display the qualitative features and save computation time. </p><p>Even with these approximations, computation times of hours  were required for the full simulation. For this reason, many of  the results shown were computed using the approximation that  calcium diffusion in the cleft is at steady-state during the dwell  time in any given macrostate, which accelerates the computation  by about two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of this approximation depends on the density of fixed calcium binding sites in  the diadic cleft. In the absence of such sites, it agrees with the full  simulation to within a few percent. In the presence of low affinity  fixed Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites at the density estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Post and  Langer (1992)</xref>, errors of 30&#x02013;50% may occur with the steady state  approximation, but the qualitative features of the results appear  to be correct, and most of the quantitative results can be recovered by use of effective values of channel parameters that are well  within the large experimental uncertainties (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The fixed  buffer sites in the cleft do not appear explicitly in the steady state  diffusion approximation since these sites are nonmobile and  therefore have no effect on the steady state distribution of  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], although they control the rate at which the steady state  profile is established after a change in the sources. </p></sec><sec><title>L-Type Channel</title><p>There is no consensus on the gating scheme of the L-type sarcolemmal calcium channel. In these simulations, it was modeled  using a novel 24-state gating scheme that we developed as an improvement of the scheme recently proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Jafri et al. (1998)</xref>.  The new scheme combines the scheme of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Imredy and Yue  (1994)</xref> for calcium-dependent inactivation with that proposed by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Shirokov et al. (1993)</xref> to explain gating charge movement and  voltage-dependent inactivation. This scheme (shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A)  consists of four-gating modes (normal, calcium-inactivated, voltage inactivated, and both calcium and voltage inactivated). This  model is in the process of being validated and parametrized using measured whole cell and single channel calcium currents.  For the purposes of this paper, it may be thought of as an empirical source of DHPR openings that act as input to the CICR process. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, B and C, shows representative L-type calcium currents measured from a rat cardiac myocyte in the presence of 10  &#x003bc;M ryanodine. The parameters of the L-type gating model were  adjusted manually to fit these data, as shown, and these parameter values were used for most of the simulations shown in the rest  of the paper without any further adjustment. They should not be  considered necessarily optimal or unique.  </p></sec><sec><title>RyR Gating Schemes</title><p>Simulations were carried out using six different gating schemes  for RyR2, shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Two of these are phenomenological  schemes representing, in simplest form, the combination of activation by binding of two calcium ions and either calcium-dependent or fateful inactivation. The other four are published gating  schemes based on single-channel observations of purified RyRs  in lipid bilayers. </p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of SR Release Flux</title><p>SR release flux was measured by the recently developed Oregon  green/EGTA method, which has been described in detail by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Song et al. (1998)</xref>. In brief, adult rat ventricular cardiac myocytes  were enzymatically isolated and studied under whole cell patch-pipette voltage clamp. The fast, low affinity fluorescent calcium  indicator Oregon green 488 BAPTA 5N (1 mM) and EGTA (4 mM)  were dialyzed into the cell from the pipette. As we have shown  previously, this combination gives a fluorescence signal dominated by a term directly proportional to SR release flux. Myocytes  were imaged in the line scan mode of an inverted confocal microscope (LSM-410; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="zeiss">Carl Zeiss, Inc.</named-content>), with the scan line oriented  longitudinally. This method makes it possible to see the localized  SR release at the Z line of each sarcomere. Whole cell calcium release rate was estimated by averaging over the length of the scan  line.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>results</title><sec><title>Local Control Produces Graded Release of SR Calcium</title><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows representative measurements of calcium  release flux from the SR of a rat cardiac myocyte, compared with simulations using the phenomenological  RyR gating Scheme 5 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> (left) shows the  time course of SR release flux during a single voltage  clamp depolarization to 0 mV from a holding potential  of &#x02212;70 mV. The figure demonstrates that the local control model can simulate the observed time course of release, particularly the fact that release declines during  sustained depolarization. The fact that release in this  model is dependent on local geometry is illustrated by  the much smaller dotted curve, which shows the release  flux that would be computed assuming a diadic cleft  height of 30 nm instead of the correct 15 nm. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  (right) shows the peak release flux as a function of the  voltage of the clamp pulse. I<sub>Ca</sub>, the macroscopic current  of the L-type channels, shows the bell-shaped voltage  dependence typical of voltage-controlled ion channels,  while the SR flux recapitulates (approximately, see below) the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ca</sub>, but at an absolute  magnitude 10-fold larger. The simulation reproduces  these features well. This demonstrates the central point  of the local control hypothesis: the complicated stochastic interactions of calcium-coupled channels can  produce high amplification with stable, graded control  by trigger calcium.  </p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, if the bell shaped I<sub>CaL</sub> vs. V and I<sub>SR</sub>  vs. V curves are normalized to their respective peaks,  there is a small difference between their positions.  When these curves are then divided to give a plot of the  gain of excitation&#x02013;contraction (EC) coupling (peak I<sub>SR</sub>  divided by peak I<sub>CaL</sub>), the resulting gain diminishes  with voltage. This was one of the original predictions of  the local control theory, which has been confirmed in  several laboratories (Wier et al.<italic>,</italic> 1994; Cannell et al.<italic>,</italic>  1995; Janczewski et al.<italic>,</italic> 1995; Santana et al.<italic>,</italic> 1996). It  stems from the fact that local activation of the RyR depends on the unitary current of the triggering L-type  channel(s) rather than on the macroscopic ensemble-average current. As pointed out previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cannell et  al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Santana et al., 1996</xref>), the decline of gain at  positive voltages is a manifestation of the cooperativity  of RyR activation by calcium, because the diminution  of L-type unitary current as the calcium reversal potential is approached reduces I<sub>SR</sub> disproportionately in  comparison to its linear effect on macroscopic I<sub>CaL</sub>. As  argued by those authors, a quadratic dependence of  RyR activation on local calcium should result in a macroscopic gain that is roughly proportional to the L-type  unitary current. The decline of gain with voltage in the  simulations is steeper than that of the L-type current  over the midrange of voltages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B), even though  activation of the RyR was assumed to require two Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  ions. This &#x0201c;elbow&#x0201d; in the voltage-gain relation results  from the depletion of SR calcium (by release to the cytosol) during the depolarization, as indicated by the  fact that it is prevented if SR depletion is minimized by  reducing the number of diads per unit cytosolic volume, or reducing the number of available L-type channels (not shown). Such an elbow has been observed experimentally in intact cardiac myocytes (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> in  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Wier et al., 1994</xref>). It was not seen when I<sub>CaL</sub> (and therefore I<sub>SR</sub> and SR depletion) was reduced by a factor of 20  with nifedipine in order to study calcium sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Cannell et al., 1995</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>SR Calcium Release Is Locally Regenerative</title><p>The number of RyRs that contribute to SR calcium release at a single diad is not known. As an index of that  number, we computed the mean number of RyR openings per diad during a clamp pulse to 0 mV for 50 ms,  averaged over those diads at which at least one RyR  opening occurred. Neither the unitary current <italic>i</italic><sub>RyR</sub> of  the RyR nor its calcium sensitivity in situ is well known.  We therefore varied the RyR permeability over two orders of magnitude, adjusting the sensitivity <italic>k</italic><sub>o</sub> in each  case to give the observed macroscopic gain of 10 at 0 mV  and standard SR loading, to determine whether there  could be a regime in which an L-type channel communicates with a single RyR without regenerative local recruitment of other RyRs. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, the mean  number of RyR openings per diad has a U-shaped dependence on <italic>i</italic><sub>RyR</sub>, with a nadir of &#x0223c;11 (achieved, coincidentally, near the estimated physiologic <italic>i</italic><sub>RyR</sub> of 0.4 pA;  Mejia-Alvarez et al.<italic>,</italic> 1999). This shows that, at least in  the context of this model, RyR activation is always locally regenerative. This result can be understood qualitatively as follows. If <italic>i</italic><sub>RyR</sub> were small, the RyR sensitivity  would have to be high, since many RyRs would need to  be recruited to achieve the macroscopic gain of 10. If  <italic>i</italic><sub>RyR</sub> were high, on the other hand, the sensitivity must  be low, as a result of which the coupling from DHPR to  RyR frequently fails. The release in this case is made up  of rare diadic release events, each of which is highly regenerative. The fact that the DHPR-RyR communication  fails before RyR&#x02013;RyR recruitment is basically a consequence of geometry: if the DHPRs are located randomly  at the junction, they cannot, on average, be much closer  to RyR sensing sites than the latter are to the release  pores of neighboring RyRs. If DHPRs were located in  registry with RyRs, and if the calcium-sensing site of the  latter were located on the &#x0201c;top&#x0201d; of the foot process,  within a few nanometers of the DHPR, then nonregenerative 1:1 communication would be possible, as originally  envisioned in the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Gy&#x000f6;rke and Palade (1993)</xref>.  </p></sec><sec><title>Local and Global Stability</title><p>Before discussing simulations using empirically determined RyR gating schemes, we define two different  concepts of stability. Local stability refers to the fact  that there must be some mechanism to terminate the  regenerative release at an individual diad. Global stability refers to the fact that the resting state of the myocyte  must be stable against regenerative build up of global  calcium, and the cell must eventually relax to this resting state after stimulation. The average diadic release  rate triggered by global cytosolic calcium must, therefore, be less than the removal rate (SR pump &#x0002b; Na/Ca  exchange) in the vicinity of the resting state. These two  concepts of stability are distinct, though related. If  there were no calcium removal, [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> would eventually build up to cause global regenerative release, no  matter how well behaved the RyRs. On the other hand,  it is evident that a cell cannot return to the resting state  unless local release terminates. Both forms of stability  are adversely affected by the clustering of RyRs. Clustered RyRs will have a more regenerative local release,  which will be more difficult to terminate. Release triggered by background calcium will also be enhanced by  clustering, since if a single RyR in the cluster opens in  response to background calcium, this will trigger opening of most of the other RyRs in the cluster.</p><p>There are three mechanisms that contribute to the  termination of local release: (a) depletion of SR calcium, (b) inactivation of RyRs, and (c) stochastic attrition. The last refers to the fact that for a finite-size cluster of RyRs, gating stochastically, there is always a nonzero probability that all RyRs will be closed at the same  time, and this event will interrupt the positive feedback  and extinguish the activity of the cluster, as long as  there are no further DHPR openings to re-ignite it. SR  depletion cannot be the principal mechanism of local  release termination, since release terminates after voltage steps to very negative or positive voltage, which release very little of the SR calcium stores, and release in  calcium sparks (Cheng et al.<italic>,</italic> 1993) also terminates despite the fact that there is no global SR depletion. Conversely, greatly prolonged sparks occur in the presence  of ryanodine (Cheng et al.<italic>,</italic> 1993), indicating the absence of local SR depletion. Inactivation and stochastic  attrition must, together, be capable of terminating release at a single diad.</p><p>The contribution of stochastic attrition may be  roughly estimated from a simple, analytical model.  Consider a &#x0201c;cluster&#x0201d; of <italic>n</italic> identical channels, each of  which has only two states, open and closed. Start with  each channel in equilibrium, with an open probability  <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> and an opening duration &#x003c4;<sub>o</sub>. The channels are assumed to gate independently, except that, if all close at  once, the cluster is considered to be extinct. So long as  the cluster is &#x0201c;alive,&#x0201d; the number of open channels, <italic>n</italic><sub>o</sub>,  will be binomially distributed, except that <italic>n</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0003d; 0 is excluded.

Some numerical values are instructive. For a cluster of 25 channels with a mean opening duration of 10  ms and <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0003d; 10%, &#x003c4;<sub>attrit</sub> is &#x0223c;46 ms. For 75 channels with  a 50% open probability, it becomes 160 billion years,  &#x0223c;10&#x000d7; the age of the universe! This makes it clear that  stochastic attrition alone cannot be relied upon to terminate local release robustly if the number of RyRs in a  diad is as large as present ultrastructural data indicate.  There must also be an inactivation process that is capable of substantially reducing <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>. For an opening duration of 10 ms, one finds numerically that to extinguish  clusters with a time constant of 50 ms requires <italic>nP</italic><sub>o</sub> &#x0003c;  2.6. Therefore, for RyR clusters of the size found in cardiac muscle, local stability requires an inactivation process that, while it need not be completely absorbing,  can reduce the RyR open probability to a few percent  or less. It needs to be kept in mind, however, that stochastic attrition is not an alternative to inactivation, but  an intrinsic feature of multichannel local control models, which always contributes to the cluster extinction  process regardless of what other mechanisms are  present.</p></sec><sec><title>Fateful Inactivation of RyR Gives Stable EC Coupling</title><p>Since the stability of local control EC coupling depends  critically on the inactivation process of the RyR, it is  reasonable to ask whether the calcium-dependent inactivation mechanism employed in the phenomenological gating of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Scheme 5, is essential to the success  of the model. The answer is no; as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, qualitatively comparable results can be obtained with Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>,  Scheme 6, in which inactivation is fatefully linked to activation, but not explicitly dependent on calcium (as  suggested by Pizarro et al.<italic>,</italic> 1997). In this scheme, unlike Scheme 5, the activation and inactivation &#x0201c;gates&#x0201d;  are not independent. The inactivation and repriming  rate constants (vertical transitions) are different in the  calcium-free and -activated states of the channel (subject to the constraint of microscopic reversibility, which  requires that the products around the loop of forward  and reverse rates be equal). By proper choice of these  rate constants, it can be arranged that, on exposure to  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> the channel first activates and then inactivates,  while on removal of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, channels predominantly deactivate before repriming, avoiding another passage  through the open state. This arrangement requires  some tuning to secure sufficiently rapid decay of release both on depolarization and repolarization. </p></sec><sec><title>Bilayer-derived RyR Gating Schemes Give Unstable EC Coupling</title><p>We now turn to consideration of models based on the  empirically derived RyR gating Schemes 1&#x02013;4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>.  Each of these schemes proves to have one or more deficiencies that preclude local and global stability. We can  consider, first, Scheme 3 proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Keizer and Levine (1996)</xref>. This scheme was developed to explain the  &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; of the RyR observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Gy&#x000f6;rke and Fill  (1993)</xref>. When used in an ensemble-average sense,  where [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] is taken to be a global value imposed by  the researcher, this scheme gives a reasonable description of RyR adaptation as seen in bilayers with Cs<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as  current carrier. It is clear, however, that it cannot be  considered as a description of microscopic events in a  local control model, because it has a calcium-dependent transition between two open states. As shown in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, once the channel reaches state O1, it will be exposed to the microdomain of high [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] created by its  own permeating calcium. This will immediately induce  a transition to O2, precluding any opportunity for inactivation or adaptation. The rate and extent of inactivation will be minimal in a local control setting, preventing termination of local release, as was confirmed by  carrying out the simulation with this gating scheme  (not shown).</p><p>The remaining three schemes of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> share certain  features. All have a slow inactivation process, which is  calcium dependent only in Scheme 4. Each also has the  possibility of opening the channel after binding only a  single calcium ion, although only Scheme 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Zahradnikova and Zahradnik (1996)</xref> has only one calcium  binding site. Each of these schemes was put forward  with a set of rate constants determined by measurements in lipid bilayers, in the absence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and  ATP. To incorporate these schemes into the local control simulation, it is necessary to decide how (if) these  constants should be modified to describe the channel  in the intracellular milieu. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Scheme 1, for example, has an open state reachable after binding two Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>,  as well as one reachable with only a single calcium.  Clearly, by completely rearranging the rate constants, it  would be possible to make this scheme behave somewhat similarly to the phenomenological Scheme 6. But  Scheme 1 was determined by very careful fitting to a series of data on transient activation after flash photolysis  of caged calcium, taking into account the transient  overshoot of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] after the flash. It makes little sense  to discard this information. We therefore explored parameter values according to the following strategy.  Since all lipid bilayer schemes studied in the absence of  Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and ATP gave activation rates that were much too  high for local control, we reduced the rates of calcium  binding by about two orders of magnitude to account  for the effect of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> competition; the exact factor  used was determined by requiring the gain (ratio of  peak release current to peak I<sub>CaL</sub>) to be 10 for a depolarization to 0 mV. This criterion was relatively independent of the values of rate constants related to adaptation/inactivation. When the resulting models failed  to show adequate stability, we examined the effect of increasing the kinetic rates of adaptation/inactivation  steps by a factor of &#x0223c;20, consistent with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Valdivia et al. (1995)</xref>. This also failed, whereupon we examined the effect of increasing only the forward rates of inactivating steps, thereby stabilizing the  inactivated/adapted states. This strategy was limited by  the onset of an unacceptable degree of inactivation in  the resting ([Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] &#x0003d; 100 nM) condition, and moved  the steady state activation curve rightward so that the  steady state <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> approached unity only at [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] values  over 100 mM. Even with these adjustments, all three  schemes gave models that manifested local instability  (failure of release termination after activation) or global instability (spontaneous activation by background  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]). Because of these instabilities, [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> fails to  relax to the resting value following repolarization, as  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A (Schemes 1 and 2). The process of parameter exploration is illustrated for Scheme 2 in B&#x02013;D.  Initially, the bilayer-derived rate constants were kept, except that the rate of calcium binding to the activating  site (<italic>K</italic><sub>RC1</sub>) was decreased from 1,000 to 16 mM<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> ms<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,  consistent with a competitive effect of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, giving an  apparent gain of 10 for a depolarization to 0 mV, starting with all channels in the resting state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B). The  apparent success of this parameter set is illusory, as  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> C, where the depolarization is preceded  by a 1-s conditioning run-in at the holding potential.  Exposure to background calcium triggers a spontaneous SR release, which continues indefinitely, partially  inactivating the channels so that, in the true resting  state, the gain at 0 mV is reduced to only &#x0223c;1. As shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> D, variation of the activating rate constant  (<italic>K</italic><sub>RC1</sub>) over a fourfold range and of the inactivating  rate constants (for <italic>K</italic><sub>O1C2</sub>, <italic>K</italic><sub>O2C2</sub>, and <italic>K</italic><sub>C2I</sub>, refer to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>,  Scheme 2) over a 100-fold range was powerless to recover the normal gain in the true resting state of the  model. Extensive parameter variations of this kind  failed to identify a satisfactory parameter set for  Schemes 1 or 2. The authors of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Scheme 4, did  not specify a complete set of kinetic constants for the  scheme, but it suffers from the same generic problems  as the first two: slow and incomplete inactivation (73%  at pCa 3) and activation by only a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion. </p><p>The global stability problem that arises if the RyR can  be activated by a single calcium ion can be demonstrated in a relatively model-independent way. The  time-averaged local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] at a distance <italic>r</italic> from an L-type  channel with an open probability <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, passing a unitary  calcium current <italic>i</italic><sub>CaL</sub>, considered as a point source, is  given by <disp-formula id="E2"><label>2</label><tex-math id="M3">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

Using this value, and assuming a unitary current of 0.1 pA and an (effective) calcium diffusion coefficient of 0.15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the time-average local  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] at a distance of 10 nm from the L-type channel  is only 1.4 &#x003bc;M, which is comparable to the global  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> reached during a forceful beat, and only 14&#x000d7;  resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>. A RyR that opens as the first power of  local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] cannot, therefore, discriminate against activation by global background calcium, because the average release flux will be proportional to the average  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], which has a major contribution from nonlocal  background calcium. This implies that globally stable  local EC coupling cannot be achieved by any RyR that  can be activated by a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion, assuming that the  position of DHPRs is random in relation to the RyR lattice so that the average distance from DHPR pore to  RyR sensing site is &#x0223c;10 nm.</p><p>The previous argument tacitly assumed that an RyR  with only a single calcium binding site would have a  time-averaged open probability roughly proportional  to the time-averaged local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]. It might be argued  that this is not necessarily so: there could be schemes in  which the occupancy of the single binding site is proportional to the local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], but the mean RyR <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> during repeated exposure to brief pulses of high [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] is  larger, as a result of nonlinear steps downstream from  the calcium binding reaction. The difficulty with this  argument becomes apparent if one tries to construct  such a model. For a single RyR in isolation, the binding  site occupancy translates into the probability that the  Markovian channel is found in certain states. But how  is one to make the open probability depend nonlinearly on this probability when the master equations  governing Markov transitions are linear? For the case  of a channel with a microreversible (i.e., thermodynamically passive) gating scheme exposed to a steady  calcium level, we can be quite rigorous about this. The  equilibrium law of mass action requires that the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> be a  rational function of degree 1; i.e., a Michaelis-Menten  function. The question, then, is whether there could be  a gating scheme in which the non&#x02013;steady state effects  of exposure to a train of brief, very high pulses of  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] could &#x0201c;pump&#x0201d; the channel into a higher <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> than  predicted by linear extrapolation from the resting  state. The experimental constraints on this problem  are actually very strong. In a resting cardiac myocyte,  calcium sparks occur at a rate of 100 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cheng et al.,  1993</xref>). If the spark corresponds to a release of 4 pA for  10 ms, and if the RyR unitary current is 0.4 pA, then  resting spark release amounts to an average of only  &#x0223c;10 open RyRs per cell. If there are, conservatively, 10<sup>5</sup>  RyRs per myocyte, the resting <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> at [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] &#x0003d; 100 nM is  10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. Is it possible that a one-calcium gating scheme with  this resting <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> could, in response to a 200-&#x003bc;s pulse of  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] &#x0003d; 100 &#x003bc;M, open with a probability of, say, 0.1?  This is a special case of a problem that has been solved  previously in connection with thermodynamic constraints  on RyR adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Stern, 1996</xref>). Using the methods in  that paper, we found that it is impossible, assuming that  the Markov scheme follows the kinetic law of mass action. We can therefore be fairly confident that the difficulty in obtaining global stability in simulations with single-calcium RyR gating schemes is generic.</p></sec><sec><title>Local Control Can Be Stabilized by RyR&#x02013;RyR Allosteric Interactions</title><p>The fact that many RyR gating schemes derived from  lipid bilayer data fail to support stable EC coupling in  simulations suggests that RyR gating in situ may differ  from that in bilayers. Two features are required to  achieve local and global stability: &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; inactivation  and cooperative activation by more than one Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion.  A possible clue as to how these features might arise  comes from the ultrastructure and molecular biology  of the RyR. In all striated muscles from crustaceans to  man, including those that are activated purely by CICR  (e.g., crayfish skeletal, mammalian cardiac) RyRs are  found in dense two-dimensional crystalline arrays, although the details of the crystal lattice have varied  somewhat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Loesser et al., 1992</xref>). Moreover, the amino  acid sequence of the foot process has been strongly  conserved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Tunwell et al. (1996)</xref> found 98.6% amino  acid identity between rabbit and human RyR2. We have  identified a sequence of 200 amino acids located in the  foot region that is 100% identical between mouse and  human RyR2, despite the presence of 82 synonymous  mutations at the DNA level (data not shown). Since  only &#x0223c;29% of random mutations are synonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Nei,  1987</xref>), the probability that all would be synonymous in  the absence of selection is only 0.29<sup>82</sup> (8.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;45</sup>).  This implies that the foot has an important (though unknown) function even though the COOH-terminal region of the molecule suffices to form a calcium-sensitive channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bhat et al., 1997a</xref>). Could the difference  between in situ and in vitro gating of the RyR be due to  allosteric interactions between the foot processes of  nearest-neighbor RyRs, which appear ultrastructurally  to be in contact? To test this possibility, we modified  the simulation algorithm to make the transition rates of  each RyR dependent on the states of its (up to) four  nearest neighbors. To satisfy the constraint of microscopic reversibility, the interactions were specified in  the form of free energies of interaction between neighboring RyRs, depending (symmetrically) on the states  of each. To determine the transition rate <italic>K</italic><sub>ij</sub> of a given  RyR from state i to state j, the sum of the allosteric contact energies with its neighbors (in their present states)  were added up in the initial and final states of the transition, and the exponential of the difference, divided  by <italic>kT</italic> was multiplied into the affinity <italic>k</italic><sub>ji</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>ij</sub> of the transition. This still leaves one kinetic degree of freedom to  determine how the effects of the free energy change  are to be partitioned between the forward and backward rate constants. The transition rate therefore has  the form <disp-formula id="E3"><label>3</label><tex-math id="M4">\documentclass[10pt]{article}

This makes it reasonable that &#x003b7;  should lie between 0 and 1, but this is not required. In  principle, each source of allosteric energy could have  its own value of &#x003b7; for each transition, but, to avoid excessive proliferation of parameters, we assumed that a  single value applies to all allosteric contributions affecting the rate of a given transition. By default, &#x003b7; &#x0003d; 0.5  was assumed, except for the case of a diffusion-limited  calcium binding reaction, for which &#x003b7; &#x0003d; 0 is logical,  since a change in the free energies cannot increase the  on-rate and would decrease it only if it engendered a  sufficient conformational change in the molecule to restrict access to the binding site, or a sufficient reduction in the magnitude of the binding energy to prevent  capture of the ion.</p><p>For the allosteric model, we used gating Scheme 2 of  Zahradnikova and Zahradnikov (1996; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), since  it can be considered a &#x0201c;worst case,&#x0201d; having slow inactivation and only a single calcium binding site. In this  model, RyRs interact both allosterically and by CICR&#x02014; a process difficult to analyze intuitively. The strategy we  used to choose the allosteric interaction energies had  two parts. To produce local stability, the forward rates  of inactivating transitions need to be increased, which  requires stabilizing the inactivated state(s) relative to  the noninactivated. A simple counting argument shows  that adding an allosteric energy <italic>E</italic><sub>ij</sub> that is equal to &#x02212;<italic>E</italic>/4  if one of the states i and j is an inactivated state and  &#x02212;<italic>E</italic>/2 if both are, will contribute &#x02212;<italic>E</italic> to the free energy  change associated with any inactivating transition of a  channel that has four nearest neighbors. To produce  global stability is somewhat more subtle, because it requires creating, de novo<italic>,</italic> cooperativity of RyR activation by calcium. Since, in Scheme 2, each RyR has only  a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site, it is necessary to create positive cooperativity between binding sites on different  RyRs. The strategy here is to add a large, positive allosteric  contact energy between a RyR in an open state and one  in the resting state. Initially, all RyRs in the diad are in  the resting state R. Binding of calcium to one of these  RyRs will move it to state C<sub>1</sub>, from which it could open  if the channel were in isolation. But, to move this RyR  to states O<sub>1</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> when it is surrounded by resting  channels would cause a large increase in allosteric energy, so this transition is effectively prevented by an energy barrier. If more of its neighbors acquire bound  calcium, moving them out of state R, the energy barrier  is decreased so that the RyR can open, effectively responding to the binding of several Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions by the array as a whole. The important insight here is that, for  this strategy to work, the underlying single-RyR gating  scheme must have a closed state with bound calcium, so  that binding of multiple Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions by the array can occur before any channel opens. If binding of the first  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is tantamount to opening of the channel, then  this event, however rare, will supply the local calcium to  permit opening of nearby channels so that the whole  array is effectively triggered by a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>Once one RyR opens, a complicated interplay of allosteric and CICR interactions ensues, including some  unexpected effects. For example, the energy barrier  that prevented opening of a RyR surrounded by resting  neighbors will, during the relaxation phase, prevent  calcium from dissociating from RyRs that are in contact  with one that is still open. We started with allosteric energies chosen by the two strategies described in the preceding paragraph, which succeeded in creating cooperativity of activation and strong inactivation. We then  made adjustments, guided by admittedly incomplete intuition, until the performance of the model was satisfactory. The final matrix of allosteric interaction energies is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> A; they are not necessarily either unique or optimal. It should be noted that in this  model we made no changes in the bilayer-derived parameters other than the introduction of the allosteric  interactions. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> B, we show typical time courses  of SR release in response to 50-ms depolarizations to  the voltages shown. While the responses are not exactly  the same as those of the phenomenological model,  they serve to demonstrate that Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Scheme 2, when  augmented by the allosteric couplings, produces locally  stable release. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> C shows the rate of release stimulated by global cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, for Scheme 2 with and  without allosteric couplings. The presence of the allosteric couplings converts the first order dependence of  release flux on global [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> into a cooperative response. This markedly reduces the rate of release triggered by global [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in the physiologic range, as  required for global stability. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, A and B, shows explicitly that the dynamics of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> after repolarization, and the spontaneous release rate when exposed to  resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> have been stabilized by the allosteric  interactions. These allosteric interactions are basically  inhibitory in character, as demonstrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, C  and D, which shows the effect of reducing the number  of RyRs by leaving random vacancies in the RyR lattice.  When the lattice is more than &#x0223c;60% filled, increasing  the number of RyRs actually decreases the absolute release rate, because the effect of allosteric inhibitions  more than compensates for the increased number of  RyRs carrying the release flux. It is striking that even a  few vacancies per diad markedly increase background  calcium release, impairing global stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> D).  </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>discussion</title><p>In contrast to the situation in skeletal muscle, it is well  established that mammalian cardiac excitation&#x02013;contraction coupling is mediated by calcium-induced calcium release. This creates the paradox of control: why  does the calcium released from the SR not feed back to  trigger more release, causing an explosive chain reaction that would release all of the calcium in the SR?  Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Stern, 1992</xref>), we analyzed some highly simplified and idealized models of stochastic CICR, with  the conclusion that local control might be able to explain graded coupling. Since that time, a considerable  amount of evidence has arisen in support of local control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">R&#x000ed;os and Stern, 1997</xref>, for a review), but we  have yet to see a single local calcium release event triggered by an identified L-type channel opening. However, considerably more information has become available about the ultrastructure of the diad junction and  the gating of L-type channels and RyRs, and computer  power has increased to the point where it is now practical to make use of this information in simulations.</p><p>Ideally, such simulations should be used to rule out  erroneous mechanisms, prove the uniqueness of correct models, and identify the numerical values of their  parameters. In practice, it is impossible to explore completely the multidimensional parameter space of these  models, so the goal must be approached in stages. First,  we ask whether local control, in a realistic setting of  diad geometry, number, and location of channels,  could explain the paradoxical gradedness of cardiac  EC coupling. This question is answered in the affirmative by the demonstration that a phenomenological local control model with numerous, regularly spaced  RyRs and multiple randomly located DHPRs at each  diad junction can display graded control of SR calcium  release flux by a sarcolemmal calcium current only one  tenth as large. In the second stage, we ask whether one  or more of the proposed RyR gating schemes based on  lipid bilayer data are compatible with local control. It is  difficult to answer this question with complete rigor,  because of the large parameter space of these schemes.  The approach that we have taken is to begin with the  parameters obtained in lipid bilayers and make a trial  series of parameter modifications consistent with known  effects of the intracellular milieu; e.g., competition of  Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> at Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites and acceleration of adaptation/inactivation kinetics. Based on these explorations,  we have drawn inferences about how and why RyR gating schemes fail in the local control model, and what  properties a successful RyR must possess. We have tried  to back these inferences with relatively model-independent arguments. The third stage would involve detailed  fitting of models to large amounts of whole-cell EC coupling data, identifying parameter values and establishing  what experiments would discriminate between competing models. This stage goes beyond the scope of this paper, although the results obtained so far offer some  tantalizing hints.</p><p>The somewhat surprising result of our stage-2 explorations is that none of the published bilayer-derived  gating schemes gives a successful local control model,  even when plausible modifications are made to adjust  for the effects of the intracellular milieu. While it is difficult to exclude rigorously the possibility that some alternative set of parameters might solve the problem, it  appears from our explorations that this could not be  done without sacrificing crucial features of the gating  behavior seen in bilayers; e.g., turning an adaptive inactivation into an irreversible one. All the schemes failed  by lack of sufficient stability. Based on our explorations, this failure appears to result from the absence of  two critical features: cooperative activation by more  than one calcium ion and a &#x0201c;sufficiently&#x0201d; rapid and  complete inactivation mechanism. The isolated RyR in  bilayer is a very artificial system, and there are many  reasons why it might not demonstrate physiological gating behavior, including the absence of other proteins  associated with the RyR at the junction (e.g., triadin,  junctin, calsequestrin). However, the most intriguing  possibility is that the missing factor is the densely  packed regular array of other RyRs that has been so  well conserved through hundreds of millions of years  of evolution. Recently, it has been reported that pairs  (and, on occasion, groups of three, four, or even five)  of skeletal muscle RyRs in lipid bilayers can gate synchronously when the associated protein FKBP-12 is  present (Marx et al.<italic>,</italic> 1998). Similar behavior is sometimes observed with RyR2 (A.R. Marks, private communication). This positive cooperativity was seen even when  barium, rather than calcium, was the permeant ion, indicating that it is probably not mediated by the CICR  mechanism. Our simulations show that cooperative allosteric interactions between nearest neighbor RyRs, interacting with CICR, can lead to stable local control of  SR calcium release by a RyR whose gating scheme in  isolation lacks the properties required for stability.</p><sec><title>Limitations of the Allosteric Gating Model</title><p>Our construction of a stable gating scheme using allosteric interaction energies should be considered only as  a proof of principle. In particular, our use of gating  Scheme 2 from Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> as a starting point should not be  construed as an endorsement of that gating scheme&#x02014; we chose it only because it displays the pathologies of  both inactivation and cooperativity in a simple form,  and because it has a calcium-bound closed state,  needed for our construction of RyR&#x02013;RyR cooperativity.  Our particular choice of allosteric energies should also  not be considered either unique or optimal. They were  obtained by starting with a certain strategy and then  &#x0201c;tinkering&#x0201d; to get improved activation and inactivation  behavior. The resulting model may deviate significantly  from observations in many areas that we did not examine carefully, such as repriming dynamics. Our choice  of allosteric interactions, while it produces positive cooperativity between RyRs, does not give rise to the  perfect synchronization of opening and closing of coupled RyRs observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marx et al. (1998)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bers and  Fill (1998)</xref> have suggested that such synchronization  among all the RyRs in a cardiac diad might be a mechanism to generate calcium sparks, as an alternative to  stochastic CICR, which also produces spontaneous  multi-channel release events consistent with observed  sparks (results not shown). It is not likely that allosteric  interactions are required for the production of sparks  since removal of FKBP12, the immunophyllin that is associated with the native RyR and is required for synchronized gating (Marx et al.<italic>,</italic> 1998), does not abolish  sparks (McCall et al.<italic>,</italic> 1996), but may actually increase  their frequency and duration and induce global calcium oscillations (Xiao et al.<italic>,</italic> 1997). This observation  finds a natural place in our allosteric coupling scheme,  which is fundamentally inhibitory in character, as  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>. In fact, for the model based on RyR  gating Scheme 2, even partial relief of the allosteric inhibitions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref> D) unmasks a much greater degree of  instability than is observed in intact cardiac myocytes  deprived of FKBP12 by either knockout or the drug  FK506. In interpreting such findings, it is important to  bear in mind that FKBP has major effects on the gating  properties of RyRs even in isolation, perhaps by mediating coordination between monomers in the tetramer  (Kaftan et al.<italic>,</italic> 1996).</p><p>There are, moreover, fundamental reasons to doubt  that allosteric coupling alone, unaided by CICR, could  produce acceptable synchronous gating of all the RyRs  at a diad. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marx et al. (1998)</xref> reported that all the components of the dwell time distribution of synchronously  gating pairs of RyR1 (two open times and two closed  times) were unchanged from those of single channels.  As pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bers and Fill (1998)</xref>, this is quite surprising on energetic grounds. One way to model such  an array is to assume that the coupling gangs together  the molecular degrees of freedom involved in gating so  that the only available states of the array are those in  which all channels are in the same state. If that were  the case, then an array of <italic>n</italic> channels would have all the  state and, presumably, transition-state, energies <italic>n</italic>-fold  larger than a single channel. For the large <italic>n</italic> found in  the cardiac diad, these increased energies, which appear as negative exponentials, would produce an overwhelming slowing of the gating process, as well as reduce the occupancy of the less probable states in the  gating scheme to negligible values. Another way to  model a synchronized array, more in keeping with our  approach in the simulations, is to assume that the gating of individual channels in the array remains well defined, but is modulated by allosteric interaction energies that are additive over all the points of RyR&#x02013;RyR  contact in the array. The fact that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marx et al. (1998)</xref>  did not observe intermediate states (one channel open,  one closed) in coupled channel pairs implies that occupancy of such states is suppressed by a positive allosteric  energy, large compared with <italic>kT</italic>, at a contact between  open and closed channels. In order for all the RyRs at a  diad to go from closed to open, it would be necessary to  pass, however briefly, through such intermediate states,  which would have an allosteric energy proportional to  the perimeter of contact between open and closed  channels. This perimeter must, at some point in the  process, be as large as the minimum diameter of the  diad, 10 or more RyRs for large diads (Franzini-Armstrong, C., F. Protasi, and V. Ramesh, manuscript in  preparation). This would represent an enormous energy barrier, which would, again, greatly slow the synchronous gating.</p><p>We are led to the conclusion that coupled gating, unaided by CICR or other exogenous sources of energy,  should be greatly slowed compared with single channel  gating. These arguments fall short of rigorous proof,  because we have assumed that the states and transitions  states of individual channels remain well defined in the  array, and that allosteric interactions can be treated as  an additive perturbation generated at the interface  between nearest-neighbor RyRs. One could, instead,  achieve coupled gating without change in the dwell  times by assuming that ganging together <italic>n</italic> channels  has a catalytic effect that reduces the transition state energies of individual channels by a factor of 1/<italic>n</italic>. Such a  long range mechanical interaction in a lattice of huge  macromolecules would be, at the least, ad hoc, although it might not be physically impossible. This argument shows that synchronous gating of many channels,  with unchanged dwell times, is not a natural consequence of the interaction of multiple RyRs. It is therefore likely, as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bers and Fill (1998)</xref>, that  allosteric interactions collaborate with local CICR to  produce the observed macroscopic and microscopic  phenomena of cardiac EC coupling. Whether this collaboration is of the form modeled here is a matter presently beyond the resolution of direct measurement. In  light of the observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Marx et al. (1998)</xref>, it is also  likely that allosteric interactions would contribute substantially to the quantitative behavior and robustness of  gating schemes (e.g., Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Scheme 6) that are not intrinsically unstable, but require &#x0201c;tuning&#x0201d; to give acceptable behavior.</p><p>Although the possible role of allosteric interactions  in cardiac EC coupling is the most novel phenomenon  to emerge from the modeling, it should be put in perspective. To achieve stable local control, two characteristics are required: &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; RyR inactivation and cooperative RyR activation by more than one Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion. Inactivation could be produced by any interaction of the  RyR with its native environment that stabilizes the inactivated state&#x02014;it is not necessary to invoke state-dependent allosteric interactions with neighboring RyRs for  this purpose. In contrast, the creation of cooperative  activation, starting from a gating scheme that permits  RyR opening in response to a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, does require  the exchange of information between RyRs. However,  it is not entirely certain that the cooperativity problem  is a real one. While published gating schemes based on  bilayer data all permit single-Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> activation, some  studies have shown the steady state open probability of  a single RyR2 depending on [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] with a Hill coefficient of &#x0003e;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Laver et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Sitsapesan and Williams,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Copello et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that intramolecular cooperativity might be adequate to achieve global  stability.</p><p>In any case, it is unlikely that any of the currently proposed RyR gating schemes captures all of the features  of importance for physiologic EC coupling. One complicating factor that we have not considered here is the  possibility that SR lumenal calcium may directly influence gating kinetics. Another (possibly related to the  first) is that increasing the SR calcium load of a rat myocyte modestly above normal provokes periodic calcium oscillations, whereas &#x0201c;latch up&#x0201d; of the cell in a stable state of high [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and high RyR open probability is never observed, even when egress of calcium from  the cell is prevented. None of the models described  above reproduces this global behavior accurately. It is  possible that &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; or other modulation of RyR  gating by sustained elevation of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] in the submicromolar range plays an important role in determining  global stability. Further simulation and experimentation will be required to determine how this and other  physiologic constraints translate into required properties of the RyR at the molecular level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><table-wrap position="float" id="TI"><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Global

In the presence of fixed calcium binding sites, the amplitude of the release  flux is only half that predicted by the steady state approximation. Most of the discrepancy can be compensated by assuming a reduced &#x0201c;effective&#x0201d; value for the RyR unitary current when using the steady state approximation. (B) Back-flux of calcium from the diadic cleft into  the SR lumen through RyRs, taken into account in the dynamic-diffusion simulations, contributes to the reduction in the effective value of  the RyR unitary current. For this computation, it was assumed that the net unitary current through the open RyR is proportional to the SR  transmembrane gradient of [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], rather than SR lumenal [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] as in the steady state simulations, thereby taking account of the possible (unidirectional) flux of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from cleft to lumen. The horizontal line shows the 0.4-pA unitary current assumed for the RyR in isolation, as in lipid bilayers. The mean in situ unitary current was defined as the ensemble-average SR release current divided by the open  probability of the RyRs. The in situ current is less than that in isolation because calcium can reflux from the cleft to the SR, either through  the channel through which it entered the cleft, or through neighboring RyRs. The latter effect makes the effective unitary current time dependent, because of the varying number of open RyRs available for back flux. Note that the net flux through the RyR can never be negative (since most of the calcium in the cleft originates in the SR), but it can be reduced by a component of unidirectional back flux.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP7866.f2"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(A) Structure of the scheme of L-type  channel gating.

(B) When release is then divided by trigger to get the  gain function of EC coupling, the resulting gain decreases with  voltage, because the efficacy of the L-type current to trigger release  from the RyR depends on the unitary current of the L-type channel, which decreases as the calcium reversal potential is approached. This effect, one of the basic predictions of local control  theory, has been confirmed experimentally by several laboratories.  Although activation of the RyR requires only two Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions in this  model, the gain declines more rapidly than the L-type unitary current (scaled to match the gain curve at &#x02212;35 mV) in the midrange  of voltages, as a consequence of partial depletion of SR calcium  during the depolarization. This &#x0201c;elbow&#x0201d; effect has been observed  in whole-cell calcium recordings, but not when the majority of the  L-type current (and therefore SR release) has been blocked with  nifedipine in order to count calcium sparks (see text).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP7866.f6"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>The unitary current of the RyR, and its calcium sensitivity <italic>k</italic><sub>o</sub>, neither of which is known precisely in vivo, were varied  over two orders of magnitude, keeping the gain of EC coupling at  0 mV equal to the experimental value of 10.

(A) The calcium binding rate of the RyR,  which may be affected in vivo by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> competition, was adjusted to give the observed gain of 10 at the initial peak of release, keeping all  other rate constants equal to their published values, and starting the simulation with all channels in the resting state R. After the stimulus,  global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] does not relax to the resting value because local release fails to terminate reliably, and new release events are stimulated by background calcium. (B) SR release flux (solid line) and sarcolemmal calcium current (dashed line) for Scheme 2, showing an  apparent gain of 10 when all channels start in state R. (C) When the depolarization is preceded by a 1-s conditioning run-in period at &#x02212;70  mV with channels exposed to global [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, there is a spontaneous release of SR calcium. The resulting RyR inactivation and SR calcium depletion greatly reduces SR release in response to the depolarization, reducing the gain to about 1 in the true resting (i.e., conditioned) state.

(C) &#x0201c;Spontaneous&#x0201d; release triggered by exposure to a constant global calcium level for Scheme 2 with and  without the allosteric interactions. The interactions cause the activation of the diad to depend cooperatively on calcium, even though each  RyR has only a single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding site. This suppresses release at physiologic levels of global [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], conferring global stability on the  model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP7866.f10"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption><p>(A) Global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] for the model using Scheme 2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) with and without allosteric interactions is shown. With  Na/Ca release disabled, there is no relaxation of global [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] after a stimulus; normal relaxation is produced when allosteric interactions  between RyRs are included. (B) Global instability of the model using Scheme 2 is revealed by major calcium release when the diads are exposed to resting global background [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] (100 nM) in the absence of depolarization. Inclusion of allosteric interactions eliminates this  background sensitivity by requiring cooperative activation by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bound to different RyRs. (C) The effect of the allosteric interactions is  basically inhibitory. As a result, if the number of RyRs per diad is reduced by leaving vacancies in the RyR lattice, there is a paradoxical increase in the rate of SR calcium release, until the number of RyR remaining is no longer sufficient to support the release. (D) The allosteric suppression of spontaneous release triggered by background calcium (C) is very sensitive to completeness of the RyR lattice. Introduction of small numbers of vacancies per diad unmasks the unstable release characteristic of Scheme 2 RyR activation by a single bound  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The effect of reducing the number of RyRs by introducing vacancies in the lattice is much larger than the effect of simply reducing  the size of a complete array, which has only a slight effect on global stability. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JGP7866.f11"/></fig></sec><ack><p>The authors thank the following individuals for invaluable information and discussions contributing to the direction and technical success of this work: Edward G.
