Few candidate substrates for ADAR1 editing are known at this point and  it is not known how substrate recognition is achieved.  In some cases editing sites are defined by basepaired  regions formed between intronic and exonic sequences,  suggesting that the enzyme might function cotranscriptionally. We have isolated two variants of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> ADAR1 for which no editing substrates are currently known. We demonstrate that both variants of the  enzyme are associated with transcriptionally active  chromosome loops suggesting that the enzyme acts  cotranscriptionally. The widespread distribution of the  protein along the entire chromosome indicates that  ADAR1 associates with the RNP matrix in a substrate-independent manner. Inhibition of splicing, another  cotranscriptional process, does not affect the chromosomal localization of ADAR1. Furthermore, we can  show that the enzyme is dramatically enriched on a special RNA-containing loop that seems transcriptionally  silent. Detailed analysis of this loop suggests that it  might represent a site of ADAR1 storage or a site  where active RNA editing is taking place. Finally, mutational analysis of ADAR1 demonstrates that a putative Z-DNA binding domain present in ADAR1 is not  required for chromosomal targeting of the protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RNA editing</kwd><kwd>chromosomal localization</kwd><kwd>RNA splicing</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes</kwd><kwd>epitope tagging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>D<sc>ouble-stranded</sc> RNA adenosine deaminase  (ADAR1, dsRAD, DRADA)<sup>1</sup> is an RNA-editing  enzyme that converts adenosines to inosines by  hydrolytic deamination in double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Polson  et al., 1991</xref>). The enzymatic activity was first discovered in  <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and was described as an unwinding and  modifying activity that converts adenosines to inosines in  double-stranded RNAs injected into embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bass and  Weintraub, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Rebagliati and Melton, 1987</xref>). Since  then, the enzymatic activity has been detected in all metazoan tissues tested (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bass, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">O'Connell,  1997</xref>). Recently, cDNAs encoding ADAR1 have been  cloned from several organisms, including human, rat, and  <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">O'Connell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough  and Bass, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The putative translation products of the cloned cDNAs  from these organisms encode proteins in the range of 130&#x02013; 150 kD and share several characteristic features. In general, the COOH-terminal ends of ADAR1 proteins from  these species are more homologous to each other than  their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal ends. Consistent with the high degree  of conservation, a conserved catalytic domain required for  deamination is found at the COOH-terminal end of all  ADAR1 homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough and Bass,  1997</xref>). Three double-stranded RNA-binding domains  (dsRBDs) are located in the central region while one or  two putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) are located  more NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">St Johnston et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, some ADAR1 proteins contain a variable number of  a tandemly arranged oligopeptide motif at their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal ends and a short protein motif that has been implemented in Z-DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Herbert et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The search for RNA adenosine deaminases has also led  to the identification of related proteins like RED1 (for  RNA-editing deaminase), which has recently been renamed to ADAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bass et al., 1997</xref>).  ADAR2 proteins are generally smaller than ADAR1 but  are quite similar in their molecular architecture. The  COOH-terminal regions contain conserved deamination  domains whereas the central region usually contains one  or two dsRBDs. In contrast, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region is  shorter in ADAR2 and related proteins than in ADAR1  (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">O'Connell, 1997</xref>).</p><p>A number of candidate substrates are currently known  for editing by ADARs. These include the genomes of  some RNA viruses, several subunits of the group of  glutamate gated ion channels and the serotonin receptor  2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Sommer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hurst et al.,  1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Polson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Burns et al., 1997</xref>; reviewed by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bass, 1997</xref>). Editing by ADAR-like enzymes leads to conversion of an adenosine to an inosine. As inosines are interpreted as guanosines by the translational machinery,  the editing event may lead to the alteration of a codon and  thus change the coding potential of the edited RNA. Interestingly, RNA editing by ADARs can be quite different  depending on the substrate. In the case of measles virus or  the <italic>Drosophila</italic> 4f-rnp RNA, for instance, multiple editing events occur quite randomly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cattaneo et al., 1988</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Petschek et al., 1997</xref>). However, careful in vitro analysis  revealed that ADAR1 exhibits a 5&#x02032; next neighbor preference for RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Polson and Bass, 1994</xref>). On the  other hand, editing of glutamate receptor subunits is quite  specific. In GluR-B RNA, editing occurs preferentially at  three different sites. Two of these sites are located in exons 11 and 13, respectively, and editing at these sites leads  to a change of the coding potential of the two affected  codons. Consistent with the observed codon change the  two sites are termed Q/R and R/G sites, respectively. A  third site, located in intron 11, does not affect the coding  potential of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Sommer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli et al.,  1994</xref>).</p><p>Although it is not proven which enzyme is required for  the editing of these three sites in vivo, in vitro studies show  that ADAR2 (RED1) can edit both the Q/R and R/G sites  efficiently while the cryptic intronic site is edited inefficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">O'Connell et al., 1997</xref>). In  contrast, ADAR1 can edit the R/G site and the intronic  site but shows little editing activity at the Q/R site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hurst  et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dabiri et al., 1996</xref>). Similar data has been obtained for the serotonin 2C receptor which is edited at a  total of four sites. Three of these sites seem to be edited by  ADAR1 while one site seems to be preferentially edited  by ADAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Burns et al., 1997</xref>). These data suggest that  different ADARs might perform site-specific RNA editing in vivo.</p><p>In mRNAs encoding glutamate receptor subunits and  serotonin receptor 2C, sites of editing are apparently defined by base-pairing between an exonic and an adjacent  intronic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Higuchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Yang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Burns et al., 1997</xref>). The formed double-stranded regions are relatively short and it has been suggested that the degree of editing at these sites is limited by  the instability of the base-paired region that increases, as  editing progresses and base-pairing is inhibited by the  presence of inosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bass, 1997</xref>). Nonetheless, the finding  that intronic and exonic sequences are required, at least in  these cases, suggests that editing might occur cotranscriptionally before introns are removed from the nascent transcript.</p><p>We have recently cloned two closely related variants of  <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> ADAR1 from an ovary cDNA library  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brooks et al., 1998</xref>). The two cDNAs are, with the exception of a few exchanges, virtually identical to the two  cDNAs isolated by Bass and coworkers which were first  termed dsRAD-1 and dsRAD-2 but have since been  renamed ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough  and Bass, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bass et al., 1997</xref>). Both proteins show a  high degree of sequence identity in their central and  COOH-terminal regions where they contain three dsRBDs  and a conserved deamination domain, respectively. However, at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus the two proteins show marked  differences. ADAR1.1 contains 14 repeats of an 11&#x02013;amino  acids long sequence motif that is only present in one copy  in ADAR1.2 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> a). ADAR1.1 is a protein of 1,270  amino acids whereas no proper AUG start codon has been  determined for ADAR1.2. However, Northern blots indicate that both proteins are well expressed and seem to encode proteins of similar molecular mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough and Bass,  1997</xref>). </p><p>To this point, no substrate RNAs for ADAR have been  identified in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, although bFGF mRNA might be  edited by ADAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Kimelman and Kirschner, 1989</xref>). However, the abundance of ADAR activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and embryos suggests the presence of several substrates for this enzyme. Furthermore, it has recently been  shown that mRNA levels of ADAR1 correlate with the  abundance of inosines present in cellular RNAs in various  rat tissues, suggesting the existence of further, yet to be  discovered ADAR1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Paul and Bass, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we set out to study the intracellular localization of <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and on lampbrush chromosome spreads. We can  show that both forms of ADAR1 associate with the nascent RNP matrix on transcriptionally active chromosome  loops but also with a special loop.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of Xenopus ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2</title><p>Part of a <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1 cDNA was isolated from an expression screen  of a lambda Zap cDNA library for RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Jantsch and  Gall, 1992</xref>). Sequence analysis identified this cDNA as a homologue of  human ADAR1 from which the 5&#x02032; end was missing. Rescreening of a  cDNA library and 5&#x02032; RACE protocols resulted in the isolation of two variants of <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1 that were identical to the previously published  <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2 sequences. Whereas ADAR1.1 had a  full-length open reading frame, ADAR1.2 had no AUG translational initiation codon. To allow expression of this clone, a self complementary oligonucleotide (5&#x02032;-CTA GCG TGT AAT GCA TTA CAC G-3&#x02032;) was inserted in frame upstream of the cDNA in the SpeI restriction site of the  pBluescript polylinker.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibody Production</title><p>For antibody production a 564-bp long EcoRI fragment encoding amino  acids 373&#x02013;561 in ADAR1.1 was cloned into pGEX 1 vector (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>)  from where the fragment was expressed as a glutathione S transferase  (GST) fusion protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21. The fusion protein was purified on  glutathione Sepharose beads (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pharmacia">Pharmacia</named-content>) according to the manufacturer's  protocol. Eluted fusion protein was at least 99% pure as judged on overloaded Coommassie stained gels. Fusion protein was dialyzed against  0.05% TFA in H<sub>2</sub>O and lyophilized. Two rabbits were immunized and  boosted in 4-wk intervals. Test sera were taken 2 wk after each injection.  After two booster injections antisera from both rabbits could recognize  endogenous ADAR1 on Western blots at which time point animals were  killed and all serum was collected. Antisera were produced by Eurogentec.</p></sec><sec><title>Myc-tagging of ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2</title><p>ADAR1.1 was tagged with six tandemly arranged myc epitopes at either  the 5&#x02032; end the 3&#x02032; end or at both ends. To do this the &#x0223c;250 bp long region  encoding the six myc tags was cloned in frame upstream, downstream or  at both ends of the ADAR1.1 cDNA. ADAR1.2 cDNA was only tagged  at its 3&#x02032; end. After insertion of the AUG start codon at the 5&#x02032; end of the  cDNA the myc-encoding sequence was cloned in frame downstream of  the ADAR1.2 cDNA sequence. Additionally, to stabilize in vitro synthesized RNAs when injected into oocytes, the 3&#x02032; UTR including a poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  tail of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> NO38 cDNA was cloned at the 3&#x02032; end of all tagged  ADAR variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Peculis and Gall, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of ADAR1.1 Deletions</title><p>Construct &#x00394;REP was made from a partial cDNA obtained from our original phage screen. This construct deletes the first 250 codons of the  ADAR1.1 cDNA. &#x00394;REP was myc tagged at its COOH terminus and the  NO38 poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tail was added at its 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Peculis and Gall, 1992</xref>).

After polishing the ends the DNA was religated. This construct deletes 363 codons  from the 5&#x02032; end of the ADAR1.1 cDNA. Translation starts at an internal  Met at codon 364.</p></sec><sec><title>Oocyte Injections</title><p>Myc-tagged ADAR1 variants were linearized at a unique restriction site  downstream of the NO38 poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tail. Capped run off transcripts were  synthesized in vitro from the linearized templates using T3 RNA polymerase. Aliquots of all RNAs were checked for integrity on RNA gels by  ethidium bromide staining. Oocytes were injected with 50 ng RNA per  oocyte and incubated at 16&#x000b0;C for 48&#x02013;72 h to allow protein synthesis to  occur.</p><p>25 to 50 ng of oligonucleotides anti-U2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Pan and Prives, 1988</xref>) or unrelated oligonucleotides (M13-20 5&#x02032;-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3&#x02032;, MJ  183 5&#x02032;-ACGGAGGATCCAATGAGTGAAGAGGAGCA-3&#x02032;) were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. Inhibition of transcription could be  followed immediately by microscopic observation of lampbrush chromosome (LBC) preparations. Oocytes were subsequently incubated at 16&#x000b0;C  for 24 h after which time transcription resumed. For double injection experiments with oligonucleotides and myc-tagged ADAR1.1 oocytes were  injected with the oligonucleotide 6 h before injection of the RNA.</p><p>Destruction of U2 snRNA was monitored by Northern blotting as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Tsvetkov et al., 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of Transcription</title><p>Transcription was inhibited either by oligonucleotide injection (see  above) or by incubation of oocytes in AMD or alpha-amanitin at concentrations of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml or 400 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively, in OR2 medium (82.5 mM  NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM  Hepes, pH 7.8). Oocytes were typically held for 12&#x02013;24 h in the presence of  those inhibitors before they were used for chromosome preparations and  immunofluorescence staining. In some cases incubation was extended for  up to 5 d. Also, to ensure uptake of the drugs, some oocytes were injected  with AMD or alpha-amanitin stock solutions. In all cases transcription  seemed completely inhibited.</p></sec><sec><title>LBC Preparations and Immunofluorescence Stainings</title><p>LBC preparations and immunofluorescence stainings were performed as  described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Wu et al.

Subsequently, slides were washed in PBS and fixed for an additional hour in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS before antibody staining.

For single immunofluorescence labeling primary antibodies were  detected with a secondary FITC-labeled antibody. For double labeling experiments the rabbit polyclonal sera were detected with a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody while mouse mAbs were detected with a  FITC-labeled antibody.

The region chosen showed only few  amino acid exchanges between the conceptual translation  products of both ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2. It was thus assumed that both proteins would be recognized by antisera  directed against the fusion protein.</p><p>Two antisera termed Sat3 and Sat4 recognized the GST  fusion protein and were thus tested for their ability to detect the endogenous protein in oocyte extracts.</p><p>Oocytes were hand enucleated and nuclei (GVs) and cytoplasms were probed by Western blotting with both Sat3  and Sat4 antisera. Both antisera showed virtually identical  results and detected a single band of &#x0223c;125 kD in nuclei  while no signal could be detected in cytoplasmic lanes. A  single band of &#x0223c;125 kD was also detected in XlA6 cells, a  <italic>Xenopus</italic> fibroblast tissue culture cell line (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> b). Both  corresponding preimmune sera showed no signal (data  not shown). The detected band of 125 kD is slightly  smaller than the predicted molecular mass of 138 kD for  xlADAR1.1. However, purified xlADAR1 also migrates  with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hough and  Bass, 1994</xref>). Similarly, ADAR1 proteins from other species also migrate faster than predicted from their amino  acid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">O'Connell et al., 1995</xref>). This anomalous  migration has been attributed to proteolytic degradation  at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of ADAR1 proteins, a phenomenon also observed for xlADAR1 (see below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Patterson  and Samuel, 1995</xref>). The presence of ADAR1 in oocyte nuclei is in good agreement with previous findings that  showed that the enzyme is confined to the nucleus until  GV breakdown occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bass and Weintraub, 1988</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether Sat3 and Sat4 antisera could detect both ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2 proteins we performed  immunoprecipitation experiments on oocytes that had  been injected with mRNAs encoding either ADAR1.1 or  ADAR1.2. Since ADAR1.2 lacks its own 5&#x02032; AUG codon  an oligonucleotide containing a suitable translational initiation codon was cloned in frame at the 5&#x02032; end of the  cDNA. Furthermore, to distinguish endogenous from injected ADAR1 proteins the cDNAs were fused in frame  with a 6&#x000d7; myc-tag at both ends (ADAR1.1) or at the  COOH terminus only (ADAR1.2). Capped mRNAs encoding the resulting fusion proteins were in vitro transcribed and injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. After  overnight incubation, nuclei were hand isolated and used  for immunoprecipitation with Sat3 and Sat4 antibodies.  The immunoprecipitated material was then tested for the  presence of myc-tagged xlADAR1.1 or xlADAR1.2. Both  antisera were capable of immunoprecipitating either protein, indicating that both proteins are recognized by both  antisera (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> c).</p></sec><sec><title>xlADAR1 Associates with the Nascent RNP Matrix and  a Special Loop</title><p>xlADAR1 is a nuclear protein. Furthermore, in some  cases ADAR-mediated editing has been shown to require  the presence of both exonic and intronic sequences indicating that this type of RNA editing might occur cotranscriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Higuchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli et al., 1994</xref>).  ADAR acts exclusively on double-stranded RNAs. The  interaction between ADAR and its double-stranded substrate RNAs is most likely mediated by the three double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) located in the  central part of the protein. However, it is not known how  substrate specificity is achieved as adenosines will be  converted to inosines in virtually any synthetic double-stranded RNA when injected into oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bass and  Weintraub, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Rebagliati and Melton, 1987</xref>). To test  whether ADAR1 might indeed act cotranscriptionally and  to determine whether ADAR1 might only associate with a  specific subset of RNAs, we performed immunofluorescence stainings of spread GV contents with our ADAR1  antisera.</p><p>Spread germinal vesicles or LBC preparations allow the  detailed observation of several nuclear structures at high  resolution in the conventional light microscope. First,  LBCs can be well observed with a nascent RNP matrix  emerging from the transcriptionally active loops which  themselves protrude from the condensed chromosomal  axes of the two paired, homologous chromosomes, termed  bivalents. Second, &#x0223c;1,500 amplified nucleoli can be distinguished. Finally, two types of spherical structures can be  distinguished in spread <italic>Xenopus</italic> GVs which, based on  their association with snRNP components, have been  termed B and C snurposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Wu et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Staining of LBCs with both Sat3 or Sat4 antisera showed  an extraordinarily prominent signal on a single set of loops  located on bivalent no. 3. In addition, there was moderate  staining of all other loops. Preimmune sera, in contrast,  showed no chromosomal staining indicating that the signals were specific for xlADAR1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and data not  shown). Staining with Sat3 showed a weak background on  C snurposomes that was also observed in the corresponding preimmune serum whereas staining with Sat4 showed  a weak background on nucleoli also observable in the corresponding preimmune serum. Those weak background  signals that were only observed at low dilutions of antisera  were thus considered as nonspecific background signals.  The staining of the brilliant loop was so intense that it  could still be detected at antisera dilutions up to 1:3,000. In  contrast, for the majority of all other loops staining was  well visible at antisera dilutions of 1:500. Thus, it was hard  to take photographic pictures with both the brilliant loop  and the regular loops at good resolutions. Therefore, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>  shows images of bivalent no. 3 including the brilliantly labeling loop and images of other bivalents, showing the label observed on all other chromosome loops. </p></sec><sec><title>myc-E&#x02013;tagged ADAR1 Mimics the Distribution of  Endogenous xlADAR1</title><p>To determine whether the observed antibody staining was  indeed specific for ADAR1, we wanted to determine the  localization of myc-tagged ADAR1.1. To do this, myc-tagged ADAR1.1 was expressed in oocytes by mRNA injection. The protein was well detectable on Western blots  24 h after injection of the mRNA. To obtain good in situ  staining, however, it was usually necessary to incubate oocytes for at least 48 h at 16&#x000b0;C. As protein synthesis did not  increase dramatically after 24 h (as judged by Western  blots) we believe that the prolonged incubation was required to displace endogenous protein by the epitope-tagged version. Staining with the mAb 9E10 directed  against the myc-tag revealed that the tagged protein colocalized with endogenous ADAR1. The majority of the  regular loops were clearly stained. In addition, the brilliantly labeling loop was also intensely decorated by the  myc-tagged protein, at least in most cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This  data indicates that ADAR1 indeed associates with the  RNP matrix found on most loops and occurs in high concentrations on a loop on bivalent no. 3.</p><p>As a further control, to show that the chromosomal  staining with both Sat3 and Sat4 antisera was specific for  ADAR1, we blocked both antisera with the fusion proteins used to generate antibodies. This blocking eliminated  chromosomal staining almost completely, leaving only a  faint signal on the intensely labeling loops on bivalent no.  3. Thus, the observed signals reflect the localization of endogenous ADAR1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>The Intensely Labeling Loop on Chromosome no. 3 Has  Several Specific Features</title><p>The brilliantly labeling loop on bivalent no. 3 was not always labeled by the myc-tagged ADAR1 protein, even  when the majority of all other loops showed clear labeling  of the RNP matrix. Labeling of this special loop not only  varied with the animal used for oocyte injection but also  required more time to accumulate high amounts of myc-tagged protein, indicating that ADAR1 turnover at this  particular loop is somewhat slower than on other loops.  Furthermore, this set of loops is also morphologically outstanding as it represents the rare occurrence of a &#x0201c;double  loop bridge&#x0201d; where the chromosomal axis at the basis of  the loop is interrupted, giving the impression of bridging  two parts of a chromosomal axis by this loop. Therefore,  we set out to analyze the brilliantly labeling loop and the  regular loops showing ADAR1 staining in more detail.</p><p>First, we tested whether the observed labeling of all  loops was RNA dependent. Therefore, we treated LBC  preparations with RNAse before staining with Sat3 or  Sat4 antibodies. RNAse treatment clearly abolished all  chromosomal staining with anti-ADAR antibodies, indicating that ADAR1 was indeed directly or indirectly associated with RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Next, we wanted to inhibit RNA  synthesis with the transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D  (AMD) and &#x003b1;-amanitin. AMD is a DNA-binding drug  that is a general inhibitor of transcription. &#x003b1;-Amanitin, in  contrast, shows dose-dependent inhibition of transcription. At low concentrations &#x003b1;-amanitin is an efficient inhibitor of Pol-II while Pol-III is inhibited at higher concentrations. The two drugs were thus either added to the  medium or injected into oocytes at concentrations high  enough to inhibit all transcription. Oocytes treated this  way were used to prepare LBCs which were subsequently  stained with either Sat3 or Sat4 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>An obvious sign for the inhibition of transcription is the  lack of transcriptionally active chromosome loops. Staining of these preparations with DAPI shows the chromosomes to be condensed and shortened. Furthermore, as  AMD also inhibits Pol-I the nucleoli show a changed  morphology and appear swollen. Consistent with the  lack of transcriptionally active loops, no staining of regular loops was observed with either antiserum directed  against ADAR1. However, the brilliantly labeling loops  on bivalent no. 3 were still intensely labeled by Sat3 and  Sat4 antisera (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Remarkably, this staining persisted  even after 5 d of incubation in AMD or &#x003b1;-amanitin.</p><p>Another possibility to inhibit transcription on LBCs is  the injection of oligonucleotides into the nucleus or cytoplasm of oocytes. Shortly after injection of the oligonucleotide transcription stops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Tsvetkov et al., 1992</xref>). 12 to 24 h  after injection of the oligo transcription resumes producing large, transcriptionally active loops. Therefore, we  tested several unrelated oligonucleotides for their effect  on transcription and ADAR1 localization on regular loops  and on the brilliantly labeling loops. The outcome of these  experiments was similar to the ones obtained with chemical inhibitors of transcription. As all loops disappeared no  ADAR1 staining was observed on the regular chromosomal loops. However, the brilliantly labeling loop was  still clearly recognizable, both morphologically and by  staining with Sat3 or Sat4 antisera, indicating that the injected oligonucleotide did not affect this special loop (data  not shown). After transcription resumed, normal staining  of most loops and the special loop on chromosome no. 3  could be seen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest  that whatever RNA is localized at this loop might not be  transcribed by a conventional polymerase, or, alternatively, is not synthesized at this location.</p><p>To test the former possibility we performed double immunofluorescence staining with mAbs H14 or CC3, both  directed against Pol-II, and Sat4 antiserum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Vincent et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Kim et al., 1997</xref>). This data showed the presence of  Pol-II on all regular loops, as a faint line of signal could be  seen throughout the axis of loops. The brilliantly labeling  loops, in contrast, showed no detectable signal with either  mAb directed against Pol-II, suggesting that no Pol-II-dependent transcription occurs at this particular loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). </p><p>Most transcriptionally active loops are decorated with a  multitude of snRNP and hnRNP components. Interestingly, all splicing components are present on the majority  of loops where they are distributed almost homogeneously  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Wu et al., 1991</xref>). However, several loops, so-called giant  loops, have been observed that lack those components  found on most other transcripts. Therefore, we tested  whether the brilliantly labeling loop on bivalent no. 3  might in fact represent such a loop by staining LBCs with  several antibodies directed against splicing and hnRNP  components. Among these was antibody K121, directed  against the 3mG cap present on most splicing snRNAs,  mAb Y12, directed against the Sm core proteins, the anti-SR  protein antibody SC35 and an antibody directed against  the cap binding protein CBP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lerner et al., 1981</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Krainer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Visa et al., 1996</xref>). All  those antibodies clearly labeled all regular loops but also  the brilliantly labeling loop on bivalent no. 3 which was  identified by double staining the preparations with Sat3  antiserum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, and data not shown). This indicates that,  despite the lack of detectable Pol-II on the special loop on  bivalent no. 3, the RNP matrix present there is associated  with all components typical for Pol-II transcripts.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear Splicing Is Not Required for ADAR1 Localization</title><p>Editing sites in some mammalian substrate RNAs are defined by short basepaired regions formed between exonic  and adjacent intronic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Higuchi et al., 1993</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Herb et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Burns et al., 1997</xref>).  This raises the possibility that RNA editing might be  linked to splicing, at least in timing if not mechanistically.  Thus, we tested whether inhibition of splicing influences  the association of ADAR1 with the RNP matrix on chromosome loops. One would expect, for instance, if spliceosome formation is required for the association of ADAR  with RNA that inhibition of splicing might lead to an increased or altered association of ADAR with the nascent  RNP matrix.</p><p>Therefore, an antisense oligonucleotide directed against  U2 snRNA was injected into oocytes which leads to destruction of U2 snRNA via RNAse H mediated cleavage  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Pan and Prives, 1988</xref>). Oocytes depleted of U2 snRNA  are defective in splicing. As mentioned, injection of any  oligonucleotide temporarily inhibits transcription in a nonspecific manner. However, after several hours normal  transcription resumes with the exception that U2 is missing from the loop matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Tsvetkov et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Destruction of U2 was monitored by Northern blotting  of RNAs isolated from individual GVs of injected and  control oocytes (data not shown). After transcription resumed, LBCs were tested for the localization of ADAR1  by staining with Sat3 antiserum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Interestingly, no  difference in ADAR1 localization could be observed in  U2 depleted oocytes, indicating that splicing and spliceosome formation is not required for the association of  ADAR1 with the nascent RNP matrix. </p></sec><sec><title>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Peptide Repeats and a Putative Z-DNA Binding Domain Are Not Required for  Chromosomal Localization</title><p>Although ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2 show a high degree  of sequence identity in their central region and at their  COOH termini, their NH<sub>2 </sub>termini differ considerably  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough and Bass, 1997</xref>). Part of this difference can be attributed to the presence of an 11&#x02013;amino acids long repeat  that is present in 14 almost perfect tandemly arranged copies in ADAR1.1 but only in a single copy in ADAR1.2. To  test whether these peptide repeats are required for proper  association of ADAR1 with the RNP matrix we have analyzed the nuclear distribution of myc-tagged ADAR1.2  and ADAR1.1 from which the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end including the peptide repeats had been removed (construct  &#x00394;REP, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). When compared for their in situ localization on <italic>Xenopus</italic> LBCs, both clones showed an identical  distribution: Strong labeling of the special loop was observed whereas moderate labeling was detectable on all  other loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This indicates that the peptide repeats  have no influence on the intranuclear association of  ADAR1 with chromosome loops.  </p><p>The 11&#x02013;amino acid long peptide repeats are followed by  a 70&#x02013;amino acid long region that is highly conserved  among all ADAR1 isoforms from various species including <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2. This sequence  motif isolated from human ADAR1 has been shown to  bind Z-DNA in vitro and has thus been suggested to be required for the localization of ADAR1 to transcriptionally  active DNA that would facilitate the association of the  protein with nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Herbert et al., 1997</xref>). To  test this hypothesis, we constructed a myc-tagged version  of <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1 from which the entire NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal  end including the putative Z-DNA binding region had  been deleted (construct &#x00394;ZBD, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In situ, this deletion variant localized like wild-type ADAR1 indicating  that the Z-DNA binding activity is not required for the recruitment of the protein to actively transcribing chromosome loops (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, this deletion variant also removes one of  two putative nuclear localization signals from the predicted  protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hough and Bass, 1997</xref>). However, Western blots of oocytes injected with this construct still showed  clear nuclear accumulation of the protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). As this  deletion still localizes to chromosomes and enters the nucleus we can conclude that this first NLS sequence located  between amino acids 291 and 307 in ADAR1 is not required for nuclear localization of the protein.</p></sec><sec><title>ADAR1 Undergoes NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal Proteolytic Cleavage</title><p>ADAR1 protein purified from endogenous sources of  various species is smaller than the calculated molecular  mass predicted from the corresponding cloned cDNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hough and Bass, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kim et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Patterson and Samuel, 1995</xref>). This obvious discrepancy  has been attributed to a proteolytic cleavage at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of the protein. It has to be noted, however,  that the smaller purified protein is enzymatically active indicating that the proposed cleavage does not influence enzyme activity (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Bass, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In the course of our experiments we have used  ADAR1.1 variants that were epitope-tagged at their NH<sub>2</sub>  terminus, COOH terminus or at both ends. Western blots  of oocyte extracts that had been injected with any of those  constructs confirmed the proposed cleavage of ADAR1.1  at its NH<sub>2</sub> terminus: oocytes injected with the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally tagged construct showed a signal at 180 kD which  was relatively faint. In contrast, oocytes injected with  ADAR1.1 tagged at its COOH terminus or at both ends  showed a much smaller signal of &#x0223c;130 kD that was much  stronger than the signal obtained from the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally  tagged protein. Additionally, the latter constructs showed  faint bands of 180 and 185 kD, respectively, representing  the full-length protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This finding is fully compatible with the proposed proteolytic cleavage in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal region of the protein. In the case of the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally tagged construct we can only detect the full-length  construct as the cleaved protein looses its tag. Since most  of the protein is cleaved, the signal derived from this construct is relatively weak. The COOH-terminally tagged  construct, in contrast, can be detected in its full-length and  cleaved version, giving rise to the two bands detected in  Western blots. As the majority of the protein is cleaved  the larger band is much fainter than the lower band.</p><p>To confirm these results we have also performed Western blots of oocytes injected with the mentioned tagged  constructs on high percentage gels. As expected, the small  NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal cleavage product of &#x0223c;25 kD can only be observed in oocytes injected with ADAR proteins tagged at  their NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end or at both ends (data not shown).</p><p>It should also be noted, that cleaved and uncleaved  products could be detected both in the cytoplasm and the  nucleus and that all tagged versions showed normal intranuclear distribution, indicating that the cleavage has no influence on the nuclear and intranuclear localization of  ADAR1.1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Editing by ADAR-like enzymes can be unspecific and affect many adenosine residues in a double-stranded region  but can also be very specific as in the case of GluR-B  mRNA where three adenosines are preferentially modified by ADAR1 or ADAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hurst et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dabiri et  al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>). Currently, it is not known  how substrate specificity of ADAR1 is achieved. It could  be, for instance, that the three dsRBDs of ADAR1 are  solely responsible for substrate recognition. This view  is supported by the finding that purified ADAR1 and  ADAR2 can edit GluR-B pre-mRNA quite specifically  without additional cofactors being required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hurst et al.,  1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dabiri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Melcher et al., 1996</xref>). Alternatively, substrate specificity could be mediated by the formation of a complex containing ADARs and other RNA-interacting proteins. However, since such complexes have  not yet been reported this model is only speculative. Finally, the deaminase domain might discriminate among  different substrates, a view supported by recent data on  Tad1p a tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase lacking any  dsRBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gerber et al., 1998</xref>).</p><sec><title>ADAR1 Localization on Transcriptionally Active  Chromosome Loops</title><p>We have shown that both endogenous and myc-tagged <italic>Xenopus</italic> ADAR1 are associated with the RNP matrix on  LBC loops and specifically localizes to a special loop. Several conclusions can be drawn from this observation. First,  ADAR1 mediated editing can, in principle, take place  cotranscriptionally as the enzyme associates with the nascent RNP matrix before transcription is completed. This  is particularly interesting when considering that intronic  sequences define ADAR editing sites in GluR-B and serotonin 2C receptor mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Higuchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Lomeli  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Herb et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Burns et al., 1997</xref>). Splicing is  a cotranscriptional process as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Beyer and Osheim,  1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Baur&#x000e9;n and Wieslander, 1994</xref>). In fact, the entire  splicing machinery can be found associated with most  chromosome loops in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Notophthalmus</italic> GVs  showing a distribution similar to ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Wu et al.,  1991</xref>). Taken together, this leaves the possibility that editing substrates in <italic>Xenopus</italic> could also be defined by basepaired regions of intronic and exonic sequences. In fact, if  editing takes place cotranscriptionally it could even be  regulated by the rate of splicing.</p><p>However, oocytes depleted of their endogenous U2 snRNA showed a normal localization of endogenous and  myc-tagged ADAR1, indicating that inhibition of splicing  does not affect the enzyme's association with the RNP matrix. In this context, it is interesting to note that injection of  anti-U2 oligonucleotides, just like injection of any other oligonucleotide, temporarily inhibits transcription leading to  removal of the RNP matrix from the chromosome loops  (with the exception of the special loop on bivalent no. 3, see  below; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Tsvetkov et al., 1992</xref>). After several hours, transcription resumes leading to well observable transcriptionally active chromosome loops. Therefore, the entire RNP matrix  visible on those loops has to be assembled de novo, including ADAR1. We can thus conclude that ADAR1 assembly  with hnRNAs does not require spliceosome formation.</p><p>The widespread distribution of ADAR1 on LBCs suggests that the enzyme's localization is not restricted to sites  where substrate RNAs are being transcribed but indicates  a substrate independent assembly of ADAR with the RNP  matrix. No editing substrates for ADAR1 have been isolated from <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Nonetheless, as RNA editing is a rare  process it is hard to imagine that all loops being associated  with ADAR1 encode substrate RNAs. The general association of ADAR1 with chromosome loops therefore suggests that ADAR1-mediated editing is not regulated by  the association of ADAR1 with the RNP matrix. Instead,  other factors such as conformation or accessibility of the  underlying RNA, or interaction with other protein components might regulate editing. However, in vitro editing reactions indicate that ADAR1 shows site-specific editing  without the need for further cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hurst et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Dabiri et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which ADAR1 associates with the  RNP matrix is not yet clear. Not all underlying hnRNAs  might contain sufficient double-stranded structures to provide binding sites for the dsRBDs. Therefore, ADAR1  might associate with the RNP matrix as part of a multiprotein complex. Such a situation has been found for Xlrbpa,  a protein exclusively consisting of three dsRBDs. Xlrbpa  is associated with hnRNAs as part of an hnRNP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Eckmann and Jantsch, 1997</xref>). Similarly, hnRNP proteins might facilitate the interaction of ADAR1 with the  RNP matrix. Nonetheless, at this point an interaction of  ADAR1 with hnRNP proteins remains to be determined.  It should be noted, however, that deletion of an individual  dsRBD from ADAR1 prevents chromosomal localization  of the protein, underscoring the importance of the RNA  binding domains for proper targeting of the protein (C.  Eckmann and M. Jantsch, manuscript in preparation).</p></sec><sec><title>The Special Loop on Bivalent no. 3</title><p>ADAR1 was not only found on the majority of regular  loops but was specifically enriched on a particular loop on  bivalent no. 3. The concentration of ADAR1 on this loop  was several-fold higher than on other loops. This finding  can be interpreted in several ways. On the one hand more  RNAs might be present on this special loop than on any  other loop. Alternatively, the RNAs on the special loop  could contain more binding sites for ADAR1. A third possibility would be that ADAR1 is localized to that loop as  pure protein or a multiprotein complex without RNA.  Protein storage loops have been demonstrated on the  LBCs of <italic>Drosophila hydei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hulsebos et al., 1984</xref>). However, the sensitivity of the loops on bivalent no. 3 to  RNAse digestion clearly demonstrates that RNAs are  present and required for the localization of ADAR1 to the  special loops.</p><p>However, several features of the special loop are unusual. First, the loop represents the rare case of a so-called  double loop bridge where the condensed chromosomal  axes is disrupted only held together by the two loops  formed from each chromatid on each of the two homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Callan, 1986</xref>). Second, the special  loops differ morphologically when compared with regular  loops. They appear somewhat smoother in texture and are  more diffracting when observed by phase contrast microscopy. Finally, and most important the special loops do not  stain with antibodies directed against RNA Pol-II and are  insensitive to treatment with inhibitors of known RNA  polymerases including injection of oligonucleotides.</p><p>These data suggest that the RNAs present on the special  loops might either be synthesized by a novel, unconventional RNA polymerase or, alternatively, might not be  synthesized there but only stored or edited at that particular site.</p><p>While the first possibility appears rather unlikely, several arguments make us favor the latter hypothesis. First,  our double staining experiments indicate that the composition of the RNP matrix on the special loops resembles  that of other Pol-II derived hnRNPs as they contain Sm  proteins, trimethyl guanosine caps, cap binding protein  CBP20 and accessory splicing factors such as SC35. It is  thus conceivable that a Pol-II transcript is made somewhere else and then transported to that particular loop  where it is found associated with ADAR1, possibly to be  edited. Such a scenario would also explain why ADAR1  localization to this loop is sensitive to RNAse digestion  but not to inhibition of transcription. The hypothesis is  also consistent with our finding that localization of  ADAR1 to this loop is not always observed and typically  requires more time than localization to the normal  loops. Transport of a transcript made on a regular loop to  the special loop on bivalent no. 3 would certainly take  more time than association of a primary transcript with  myc-tagged ADAR1 would require. In this respect, the  ADAR1-positive loops resemble the so-called sequentially labeling loops (SLL) described in urodeles. The hallmark of SLLs is their failure to incorporate <sup>3</sup>H-labeled  ribonucleosides at a fast rate and the nonhomogeneous  distribution of label along the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Callan, 1986</xref>). Regular  loops incorporate label homogeneously over their entire  length, within an hour or so, at all sites where transcription  is taking place. SLLs, instead, incorporate <sup>3</sup>H-labeled ribonucleosides very slowly beginning from the thin end of the  loop axes. Over a period of several days incorporation of  label continuously progresses along the loop axes, being  pushed forward from the thin end always leaving a sharp  margin between the labeled and unlabeled part of the loop  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Callan, 1986</xref>). It has thus been suggested that SLLs do not  represent sites of RNA synthesis but instead become labeled by associating with transcripts made at other sites  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Callan, 1986</xref>). Therefore, it seems conceivable that the  ADAR1 positive loop on bivalent no. 3 represents such a  SLL which accumulates transcripts synthesized elsewhere,  possibly for ADAR1 mediated editing. However, further  time course experiments with both <sup>3</sup>H-labeled nucleosides  and myc-tagged ADAR1 will be required to clarify this  point.</p></sec><sec><title>The Variable NH<sub>2</sub> Terminus of ADAR1</title><p>The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal end of ADAR1.1 contains an 11&#x02013;amino  acid long peptide repeat followed by a 70&#x02013;amino acid long  region which, in human ADAR1, has been shown to bind  Z-DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Herbert et al., 1997</xref>). It has thus been  suggested that Z-DNA binding might be required to target  the enzyme to sites of transcription where Z-DNA conformation is frequently observed. Targeting the enzyme to  sites of transcription by this means could then facilitate the  enzyme's association with nascent RNAs and thus help to  target newly transcribed RNAs. Our comparison of myc-tagged ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2, and of a deletion variant  lacking the putative Z-DNA binding motif clearly showed  that neither the 11&#x02013;amino acid long peptide motif nor the  Z-DNA binding region is required for targeting of the enzyme to chromosome loops. All three constructs localized  to both regular loops and to the brilliantly labeling loop on  bivalent no. 3. It thus seems as if the two naturally occurring variants of ADAR1 have similar if not equal functions. The repeated, 11&#x02013;amino acid long peptide motif has  so far only been found in ADAR1.1 of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and might  thus represent a peculiar gene only found in this pseudotetraploid species.</p><p>However, while we could show that the Z-DNA binding  domain is not required for ADAR1 association with the  nascent RNP matrix we cannot exclude that this domain is  required for enzyme function in vivo.

(c) Sat antisera can precipitate ADAR1.1  and ADAR1.2. Myc-tagged ADAR1.1 or ADAR1.2 was expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Oocyte extracts expressing either  ADAR protein were used for immunoprecipitation with Sat3 antiserum (IS), preimmune serum (PI), or Sat4 antiserum (not  shown). The precipitated material was probed with mAb 9E10  for the presence of myc-tagged ADAR1. Both ADAR1.1 and  ADAR1.2 could be precipitated by Sat antiserum (IS) but not  by the corresponding preimmune serum (PI). Positions of myc-tagged ADAR1.1 and ADAR1.2 are indicated by arrowheads.  myc-tagged ADAR1.1 can be detected in its full-length form  (185 kD) and in a smaller version (150 kD) which is probably a  proteolytic breakdown product.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9806110.f1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>xlADAR1 localizes to the nascent RNP matrix and is specifically enriched on a special loop on  bivalent no. 3.

The peptide repeats (left striped box), the  ZBD (black box), the dsRBDs (right striped box) and the deamination domain (gray box) are indicated. &#x00394;REP deletes the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal peptide repeats from ADAR1.1 leaving a single,  COOH-terminal myc tag. &#x00394;ZBD deletes a longer portion from  the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of ADAR1.1 including the putative Z-DNA  binding domain and one of two putative NLSs. ADAR1.2 does  not contain the peptide repeats and is only myc-tagged at its  COOH terminus. An artificial AUG codon was introduced at the  beginning of the cDNA. (b) Western blot of oocyte nuclei (GV)  and cytoplasms (Cytopl.) of uninjected oocytes (&#x02212;) and of oocytes expressing myc-tagged ADAR1 versions. All myc-tagged  ADAR1 versions express well and accumulate in the nucleus.  Cytoplasmic signals are seen 24 h after injection but diminish  over time as the protein is transported to the nucleus.

In the cytoplasm full-length versions (180  to 190 kD) of all three constructs can be easily detected (upper  two arrowheads). A smaller (150 kD) breakdown product can  only be detected for the two versions carrying a COOH-terminal  myc-tag (lower arrowhead). In the nucleus (GV) the breakdown  product is the most prominent form found 24 h after injection.  However, also the full-length versions can be detected in the nucleus. If the myc-tag is only present at the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus (N) only  full-length protein can be detected, indicating that the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus undergoes proteolytic cleavage.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9806110.f7"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>In situ localization  of ADAR1.2 and ADAR1.1  deletions.
