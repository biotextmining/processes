Here we analyzed the trafficking of fluorophore-tagged  viruses in HeLa and TC7 cells by time-lapse microscopy. Our results show that native or taxol-stabilized  microtubules (MTs) support alternating minus- and  plus end&#x02013;directed movements of cytosolic virus with elementary speeds up to 2.6 &#x003bc;m/s. No directed movement  was observed in nocodazole-treated cells. Switching between plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed elementary speeds  at frequencies up to 1 Hz was observed in the periphery  and near the MT organizing center (MTOC) after recovery from nocodazole treatment. MT-dependent motilities allowed virus accumulation near the MTOC at  population speeds of 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m/min, depending on the  cell type. Overexpression of p50/dynamitin, which is  known to affect dynein-dependent minus end&#x02013;directed  vesicular transport, significantly reduced the extent and  the frequency of minus end&#x02013;directed migration of cytosolic virus, and increased the frequency, but not the extent of plus end&#x02013;directed motility. The data imply that a  single cytosolic Ad particle engages with two types of MT-dependent motor activities, the minus end&#x02013; directed cytoplasmic dynein and an unknown plus end&#x02013; directed activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>adenovirus</kwd><kwd>virus entry</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>bidirectional movement</kwd><kwd>dynein/dynactin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>V<sc>iruses</sc> which replicate in the cell nucleus must target their genome to the nucleus when entering a  new host cell. One of the obstacles these viruses  encounter is the diffusional barrier imposed by the cytoplasm. Within the eukaryotic cytoplasm organelles,  solutes, and a complex lattice-like mesh of microtubule  (MT),<sup>1</sup> actin, and intermediate filament networks effectively restrict free diffusion of molecules larger than 500 kD  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Luby-Phelps, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Seksek et al., 1997</xref>). Movement of  large complexes, like membranous organelles and also ribonucleoprotein particles in developing oocytes is dependent on active processes and generally involves either the  actin or MT cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gr&#x000fc;nert and St. Johnston, 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Hirokawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Holleran et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Mermall et al.,  1998</xref>). Similarly, viral structures destined for nuclear delivery can be large complexes up to hundreds of nanometers  in diameter, and are thus not expected to move by free diffusion through the cytoplasm, but engage with some form  of active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Greber, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Whittaker and Helenius,  1998</xref>). A known form of cell-assisted pathogen movement  is the actin polymerization-dependent motility of cytosolic  <italic>Vaccinia</italic> virus and <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Cudmore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ireton and Cossart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Welch et al.,  1997</xref>). Examples for MT-dependent processes are the  movement of endosomal <italic>reovirus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Georgi et al., 1990</xref>) and  the localization of cytosolic Herpes simplex virus capsids  to the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Sodeik et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Human adenoviruses (Ads) are nonenveloped viruses,  which replicate and produce progeny virions within the  nucleus of an infected cell, i.e., epithelial cells of the upper  and lower respiratory tract, or the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Horwitz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Shenk, 1996</xref>).  The virus particle is icosahedral, has a diameter of &#x0223c;90 nm,  and is composed of an outer capsid and an inner DNA-associated core with a 36-kb linear DNA, two terminal  proteins, and condensing proteins V and VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burnett,  1997</xref>). Ads, such as the common type 2 or 5 viruses (Ad2  or Ad5), enter a new host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, reach the cytosol by acid-dependent disruption  of the endosomal membrane, translocate to the nuclear  envelope, disassemble the capsid at the nuclear pore complex, and import their genome into the nucleus (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Greber, 1998a</xref>,b). Ads have been detected in association with cellular MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dales and Chardonnet, 1973</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Miles et al., 1980</xref>), passing from nerve termini to cell bodies by axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Ghadge et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Ridoux et al.,  1994</xref>) and binding to isolated MTs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Luftig and  Weihing, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Weatherbee et al., 1977</xref>). It is, however,  not known if MTs are required for directional transport of  the virus to the nucleus.</p><p>The MT network of an interphase cell is a dynamic polarized structure. Relatively stable minus ends are localized to the MT organizing center (MTOC), which is typically located at a perinuclear position in cultured cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 1995</xref>). The dynamic, fast-growing and fast-shrinking plus ends extend towards the  cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). Directional  movement along MTs is mediated by motor proteins  which hydrolyze ATP to induce conformational changes in  their structure. Motor proteins are needed for a variety of  cellular activities, such as positioning of the mitotic spindle  apparatus, movement of mitotic chromosomes, vesicular  trafficking and maintenance of cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Vallee and  Sheetz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Hoyt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Hirokawa et al., 1998</xref>). Motors are classified according to the sequences of their motor domains and the directionality of their motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">Vale  and Fletterick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Hirokawa, 1998</xref>). Kinesin superfamily motors typically move towards the MT plus  ends, whereas dynein motors mediate minus end&#x02013;directed  movements. Alternatively to moving along MT tracks,  motor proteins can produce directional movement by promoting local MT depolymerization and holding onto the  ends of the depolymerizing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Waters and Salmon,  1996</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of the MT-dependent minus end&#x02013; directed transport processes in interphase cells require  dynein, which is typically associated with dynactin. The  mammalian dynein is composed of two heavy chains,  which contain motor domains, and four intermediate  chains and light intermediate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Vallee and Sheetz,  1996</xref>). Dynein is thought to be nonfunctional for minus  end&#x02013;directed cargo transport, unless associated with dynactin, a heterooligomeric complex of at least nine different polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Schroer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Holleran et al., 1998</xref>).  This concept has been reinforced experimentally by overexpression of the dynactin component p50/dynamitin,  which is thought to dissociate the dynactin complex and  severely affects mitosis, and also vesicular trafficking and  organelle distribution in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Echeverri et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Despite much progress on the molecular and cellular  anatomy of MT motors and their interactions with membranous cargo, much less is known about the MT-dependent transport of membrane-free particles. Another unresolved question concerns the regulation of directionality  of cargo movement. To develop an in vivo experimental  system for directional motility of a membraneless cargo,  we decided to study the dynamics of Ad2 particles in living  cells, knowing that the entry process of this virus is directed to the cell nucleus with exceptionally high efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Greber et al., 1993</xref>). Our results in HeLa and TC7  cells show that movement of cytosolic Ad2 towards the  nucleus depends on intact but not dynamic MTs. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy indicated that cytosolic  wild-type (wt) and also endosomal mutant viruses moved  with micrometer per second velocities in quasi-straight  directions over several micrometers, either towards the  MTOC or to the periphery. When the MT network was  depolymerized with nocodazole, such long-range transport  was abolished and virus distributed randomly in the cytoplasm. DNA import into the nucleus was effectively inhibited under these conditions, implying that intact MTs  are instrumental for a successful infection. Immediately  after restoring MTs, switching between plus- and minus  end&#x02013;directed virus motilities was observed at 0.5&#x02013;1 Hz frequencies, either in the cell periphery or near the MTOC,  suggesting that single virus particles engaged with both  plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed motors. Overexpression of  p50/dynamitin significantly reduced the extent and the frequency of minus end migration of cytosolic Ad, and, surprisingly, increased the frequency, but not the extent of  plus end&#x02013;directed motility. In these cells, the population  speed was clearly directed to the periphery, unlike in control cells, which transported wt Ad2 towards the MTOC.  Dynamitin overexpression, like the depolymerization of  MTs with nocodazole, did not affect the ability of wt virus  to release a fluid-phase marker from endosomes suggesting that virus escape from endosomes neither required  MTs nor dynein/dynactin. Together, the data illustrate  that cytosolic Ad uses both minus- and plus end&#x02013;directed  MT-dependent motors at micrometer per second velocities, yet, it crosses the cytoplasm at population speeds of  micrometers per minute.</p><p>This study is, together with two recent reports on electron-dense materials underneath the flagellar membrane  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>), one of the few examples describing fast bidirectional MT-dependent motilities of a nonmembrane bonded particle. Our results  extend on the notion that directional MT-dependent  transport is not only needed to establish and maintain an  asymmetric distribution of cell organelles, but also functions to direct incoming virus particles to the site of replication.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells, Viruses, Antibodies, and Chemicals</title><p>HeLa cells (human cervical epitheloid carcinoma) were grown as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Greber et al., 1997</xref>).

Geneticin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml; Alexis Biochemicals) was included to maintain the TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP cells. TR-labeled virus (1&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/ml) was added in warm RPMI-0.2% BSA-20 mM  Hepes medium, pH 7.4, for 5 min. Cells were washed several times in  RPMI medium. The coverslip was mounted to a homemade temperature-regulated chamber, covered with a glass slide, sealed with silicon grease,  and then perfused with warm RPMI medium using a plastic syringe. The  system was mounted to an electronically controlled inverted fluorescence  microscope (model DM IRBE B; Leica) equipped with a Leica 100&#x000d7; oil  immersion objective (NA 1.3), a differential interference contrast (DIC)  polarizer and fluorescein (490/7.3 nm), TR (600/10.1 nm), and Cy5 (649/ 11.4 nm) excitation filters with bandpass emission filter cubes of 510/20  nm (Dichroic 495), 615/30 nm (Dichroic 595) and 690/40 nm (Dichroic  660), respectively (Omega Optical). Fluorescence images were recorded  with a digital, back-illuminated charge coupled device camera (TE/CCD-1000, TKB grade 1; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="Princeton&#x00025;20Instruments">Princeton Instruments</named-content>) onto a 1,000 &#x000d7; 800 pixel chip  (15 &#x000d7; 15 &#x003bc;m/pixel) at 12 bit/500 kHz/&#x02212;40&#x000b0;C using a PCI interface card  and the MetaMorph software package (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="Universal&#x00025;20Imaging">Universal Imaging</named-content>).

Depending on the cell  type and the length of the observation period, 20&#x02013;80% of the particles  showed continuous plus- or minus end&#x02013;directed translocation in five or  more subsequent frames over several micrometers.

Particles larger than  50 nm, such as Ad2, are expected to have essentially no  diffusion mobility under physiological conditions. To test  if cytosolic virus was localized to the nucleus in the absence of energy metabolism at a reduced temperature, we  bound TR-labeled Ad2 to the surface of HeLa cells in the  cold and internalized for 29 min at 37&#x000b0;C. During this time  virus is taken up into the cytoplasm but is not yet targeted  to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Greber et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1997</xref>). Cells were subsequently shifted to 4&#x000b0;C and incubated in the cold for up to  60 min postinternalization, whereas control cells were kept  at 37&#x000b0;C. Since exposure of cells to reduced temperatures  causes depolymerization of MTs, targeting was also analyzed in cells that had been pretreated with the MT-stabilizing drug taxol. In control cells the large majority of virus  particles was directed to the nucleus during the 60-min internalization, in agreement with previous results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Greber et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast, at reduced temperatures,  with or without taxol treatment, virus particles were found  randomly distributed in the cytoplasm at 60 min. The same  result was obtained if the cold incubation was extended up  to 90 min (data not shown). Virus particles also remained  cytoplasmic if cellular ATP levels were reduced after 30  min of internalization by shifting cells into a glucose-free  medium containing 10 mM sodium azide and 20 mM  2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (data not shown). These results confirmed that incoming Ad2 does not move through the cytoplasm by diffusion, but uses some form of mediated  transport. </p></sec><sec><title>Microtubule-dependent Minus End&#x02013;directed Transport  of Cytosolic Virus</title><p>Previous EM studies have detected Ads in close association with MTs both in vivo and in vitro (data not shown)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Dales and Chardonnet, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Luftig and Weihing, 1975</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Weatherbee et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Miles et al., 1980</xref>). To ask  whether MTs are actually needed for directional transport  of virus to the nucleus, we first tested if virus could be detected at the MTOC in cultured epitheloid HeLa cells. In  these cells the MTOC predominantly contains the minus  ends of MTs and is located in the perinuclear area as confirmed with an anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin immunostaining and confocal microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). As expected (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Moudjou et al.,  1996</xref>), &#x003b3;-tubulin was found all over the cytoplasm but was  concentrated at a perinuclear location (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A, green  dot). Of a total of 101 examined cells, 75% had a perinuclear enrichment of incoming virus at 60 min postinfection  (p.i.). At 15 min postinternalization no enrichment was observed. </p><p>We next analyzed if intact MTs were required for virus  targeting to the nucleus. HeLa cells were incubated with  20 &#x003bc;M nocodazole for 30 min and virus was bound to the  cell surface for 60 min in the cold to synchronize infection  and to further depolymerize MTs. Cells were then shifted  to 37&#x000b0;C in drug-containing medium for 75 min. Under  these conditions, MTs were completely depolymerized as  shown with mAb 1A2 and anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-tubulin immunostainings (data not shown). Nocodazole strongly, but not completely inhibited localization of TR-labeled virus to the  nuclear envelope as indicated by confocal microscopy  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B, panel c). Similar results were obtained if the  internalization time was extended to 135 min (data not  shown), thus suggesting that the low level of nuclear targeting was most likely due to particles entering from a  plasma membrane area near the nucleus. If MTs were restored by washing out nocodazole for 75 min, significant  virus targeting to the nucleus was observed, similar to cells  not treated with the drug (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B, panels a and e). These  results were confirmed by analyzing viral DNA import  into the nucleus in nocodazole-treated cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy at 180 min p.i. Control cells (no drug) had  a strong signal of viral DNA inside the nucleus as concluded from an anti-lamin immunostaining of the nuclear  envelope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> a). Noninfected cells had no viral DNA  signal, indicating that the FISH conditions were specifically detecting viral genomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> c) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Greber et  al., 1997</xref>). In nocodazole-treated cells most of the DNA  signal was present in the cytoplasm, sometimes in an aggregated form (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> d). Note that the combined cytoplasmic signal was somewhat lower than the nuclear signal in  the control (no drug)-treated cells, partly because some  cytoplasmic virus had been artificially released during the  FISH treatments. The absence of viral DNA in the nucleus  was not due to a lack of detection or rapid nuclear export,  since viral genomes were readily found in the nucleus of  cells that were treated with nocodazole beginning at 90  min p.i., when the majority of virus particles had already  arrived at the nuclear envelope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> f). The cytoplasmic  DNA signals in the nocodazole-treated cells decreased after washing out the drug and a strong nuclear DNA signal  appeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> e). Taken together, these results suggested that intact MTs are needed for targeting of incoming virus particles to and for import of viral DNA into the  nucleus. </p><p>It was possible that nocodazole affected endocytosis  and/or virus escape from the endosome. We therefore  measured the internalization of [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine virus into  drug-treated cells using a cell surface trypsinization assay, which measures virus uptake by the emergence of a  trypsin-resistant form of the major capsid protein hexon  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Greber et al., 1993</xref>). The results indicate that in the presence of nocodazole half of the virus particles were endocytosed at 15 min postwarming, whereas in control cells the  half-time of internalization was &#x0223c;9 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). The efficiency of entry at 30 min postwarming was close to 75%  under both conditions. The remaining viruses were most  likely shed from the cells into the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Greber et al.,  1993</xref>). The data demonstrated that virus uptake into cells  lacking intact MTs was slightly slower, but no less efficient  than into control cells, in agreement with earlier observations showing that nocodazole had no effect on the formation of endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>). </p><p>We next asked if virus was able to escape from endosomes in cells lacking MTs. To visualize both endosomes  and virus particles at high resolution we used a fluid-phase  endosomal marker, HRP, in combination with EM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>  B). HeLa cells were pretreated with nocodazole for 15  min. Wt or a mutant virus, ts1, which is unable to escape  from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Greber et al., 1996</xref>), were bound to the  cells at 4&#x000b0;C. Ts1 has a point mutation P137L in the protease reading frame and, when grown at the nonpermissive  temperature, produces particles, which fail to escape from  endosomes in a new round of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Weber, 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Greber, 1998b</xref>). Virus internalization then occurred in the  presence of HRP and drug for 15 min at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by  a 15-min chase without HRP in the presence of nocodazole. HRP activity was visualized by incubating the fixed  cells with diaminobenzidine, which is converted to an electron dense product by HRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Doxsey et al., 1985</xref>). Control  cells (no drug) contained numerous cytosolic wt particles,  also near nuclear pore complexes, but only few viruses  were detected within vesicular structures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, panel  a). Interestingly, these cells contained essentially no vesicles with HRP reaction product, in contrast to noninfected  cells, suggesting that contents of endocytic vesicles were  released (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, panels a and b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Prchla et al., 1995</xref>). Nocodazole-treated cells contained numerous virus particles  in the cytosol and only few HRP-positive endosomes, similar to control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, panel b). These cytosolic particles were clearly distinguishable entities and often occurred in clusters. Ts1 viruses, on the other hand, were  exclusively detected within HRP-containing vesicles, as  expected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, panel c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Greber et al., 1996</xref>). We concluded that MTs were not needed for Ad2 uptake into  cells and delivery to the cytosol, but were required for targeting of cytosolic virus to the nucleus.</p></sec><sec><title>Microtubule-dependent Transport of Cytosolic and  Endosomal Viruses at Micrometers Per Second</title><p>A recent report stated that fluorophore-labeled Ad5 particles were able to move in the periphery of human A549  cells over short distances with apparent velocities of 0.5&#x02013; 0.6 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Leopold et al., 1998</xref>). We aimed at analyzing the  mechanisms underlying this motility and wanted to test a  possible involvement of MTs.</p><p>We conducted extensive particle tracking analysis in  TC7 cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) and  in HeLa cells. The TC7 cells have a particularly large and  flat cytoplasm and are well suited for studies of cytoplasmic movement of Ad since they efficiently internalize and  target virus to the nucleus (data not shown). To determine  the approximate position of the MTOC we used in some  experiments a TC7 clone, which was stably transfected  with a cDNA encoding a GFP hybrid of the MAP4 MT-binding domain (MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Bulinski et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Nguyen et al., 1997</xref>). This cell line was viable in our hands  for more than 20 passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Olson et al., 1995</xref>). TR-labeled  Ad2 was internalized at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 min and the coverslip  was mounted to a temperature-controlled heating chamber placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence images were recorded in the TR channel at 1.2&#x02013; 2.6-s frame intervals over several min as described in  Materials and Methods. We use the term ES to define directional movement of particles between two subsequent  frames, negative ES indicating movement to the MTOC  (minus end) and positive ES to the periphery (plus end). At  the end of the recordings the MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP fluorescence was captured. A representative experiment is shown  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> where we traced three different particles. One peripheral particle (arrow) was followed throughout the  experiment and two MTOC-neighboring particles were  traced at the end of the experiment in frames 92&#x02013;98 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  B, arrowheads). The peripheral particle moved &#x0223c;30 &#x003bc;m in  a quasi-straight direction towards the MTOC. In Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, C  and D we plotted the distances of the particle from the  MTOC and the ES for each frame. The ES defined two  distinct types of activity periods. The first type of activity  occurred between frames 39&#x02013;44 and 68&#x02013;79 and contained  exclusively MTOC-directed motions. This activity resulted  in efficient particle advancement towards the MTOC and  typically lasted for several seconds reaching elementary  speeds of 0.17&#x02013;2.63 &#x003bc;m/s. The other type of activity was  characterized by rapidly alternating minus- and plus end&#x02013; directed ES up to 0.5 &#x003bc;m/s at nearly equal extents and frequencies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, frames 1&#x02013;38, 45&#x02013;67, and 80&#x02013;104). Such activities resulted either in a net minus end&#x02013;directed speed  of 2&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;m/min (frames 44&#x02013;68), or yielded no net movement (frames 1&#x02013;38 and 80&#x02013;104). Note that from frames  80&#x02013;104, two additional MTOC-near particles still showed  net minus- (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B, solid arrowhead) and plus end&#x02013;directed  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B, open arrowhead) movements, indicating that  cells and viruses were still motion competent.   </p><p>A population analysis of 958 ES from 15 different particles in TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP cells and 729 ES from 19  different particles in the parental TC7 cells indicated a  tailed distribution of both the MTOC- and the periphery-directed speeds, with maximal ES occurrence between 0.1  and 0.2 &#x003bc;m/s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, E and F) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). In MAP4/MTB&#x02013; GFP cells, all the MTOC-directed speeds were more  prominent than the periphery-directed speeds, in contrast  to the parental TC7 cells, in which less minus- and more  plus end&#x02013;directed ES occurred. However, even in these  cells, the minus end&#x02013;directed motion was dominant over  the plus end&#x02013;directed motion as indicated by the mean  population speed of &#x02212;0.06 &#x003bc;m/s. The MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP-expressing cells contained significantly more active particles than the parental TC7 or HeLa cells. The number of  immobile particles (ES smaller than 0.1 &#x003bc;m/s) amounted  to 12.8, 28.4, and 41.4% for TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP, parental TC7 and HeLa cells, respectively (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>).  The mean minus end&#x02013;directed speed was 0.50 &#x003bc;m/s in both  TC7 cell types, but the mean and also the peak plus end&#x02013; directed speeds were significantly smaller in the MAP4/ MTB&#x02013;GFP expressing cells than in the parental cells (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). Accordingly, the population mean speed  (comprising all the traced particles) was significantly  shifted to the MTOC direction in the TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013; GFP cells (&#x02212;0.21 &#x003bc;m/s) compared with TC7 cells (&#x02212;0.06  &#x003bc;m/s) or HeLa cells (&#x02212;0.03 &#x003bc;m/s). Although the mean minus- and plus end&#x02013;directed speeds in HeLa cells were significantly smaller than in TC7 cells (perhaps relating to the  fact that the TC7 cells allowed longer tracking analysis  than the HeLa cells), the calculated population average  speeds for wt virus were in good agreement with the observed enrichment of virus near the MTOC starting at &#x0223c;25  min to 40 min p.i. This reflects the half-time of virus penetration of endosomes which is &#x0223c;15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Greber et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the above measured speeds were truly  derived from cytosolic viruses, we analyzed the trafficking  of an endosomal mutant Ad2, ts1, in TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013; GFP cells and in parental TC7 cells. Unlike wt virus, ts1  had a population mean speed of &#x02212;0.02 &#x003bc;m/s in TC7/ MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP cells and &#x0002b;0.04 &#x003bc;m/s in TC7 cells indicating slow minus- and plus end&#x02013;directed net movements  (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). Accordingly, we have not observed ts1 virus accumulation near the MTOC up to 60 min p.i. Like wt virus,  ts1 showed a tailed distribution of ES, with the majority in  the range of 0.1&#x02013;0.2 &#x003bc;m/s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> E). In both cell types,  about 22.5% of the ES were less than 0.1 &#x003bc;m/s. A typical  ts1 trace in a MAP4 overexpressing cell shows how a virus  particle moved from a location proximal to the MTOC towards the periphery with ES of up to 1.7 &#x003bc;m/s and from  there returned to an MTOC-near location with ES of up to  2.3 &#x003bc;m/s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Taken together, the data illustrate a distinct dynamic behavior of wt and endosomal viruses further supporting the notion that wt Ad2 travels as a naked  particle along MTs. </p></sec><sec><title>Switching between Minus- and Plus End&#x02013;directed Motions</title><p>The observation that periods of minus end&#x02013;directed Ad2  transport were often followed by plus end&#x02013;directed motions along an apparently linear track could in principle be  explained by the dynamic instability of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Waters and  Salmon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). In fact, growing  and shrinking MTs were readily observed in TC7/MAP4/ MTB&#x02013;GFP cells, preferentially in the cell periphery (data  not shown).</p><p>Dynamic turnover of MTs can be experimentally eliminated by incubating cells in low concentrations of taxol  or nocodazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Waterman-Storer and  Salmon, 1997</xref>). To first test if dynamic MTs were needed  for nuclear targeting of Ad2 we pretreated HeLa cells with  25 nM taxol for 30 min. Such treatment was sufficient to  stabilize MTs against cold-induced depolymerization (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, e and h). Ad2-TR was bound to the surface and then internalized in the presence of the drug for 75 min. Similar  to control cells, the majority of virus particles were localized to the nuclear envelope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, g and h). Viral DNA  was readily detected inside the nucleus at 180 min p.i. using the FISH assay described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> b). Likewise,  treatment of TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP cells with low concentrations of nocodazole (1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M for 15 min) in the absence of cold incubations neither affected the MT network  nor virus targeting to the nucleus (data not shown). We  next analyzed Ad2 motility in MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP-expressing TC7 cells in the presence of taxol or low nocodazole.  As expected from the static entry analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B), the  population mean speeds towards the MTOC and the periphery were not significantly different from the control  cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). In cells treated with low concentrations of  nocodazole, we also observed peak minus- and plus end&#x02013; directed speeds of up to 1.7 &#x003bc;m/s (data not shown).  Although the frequencies of either minus- or plus end&#x02013; directed motions were significantly decreased in the presence of taxol and the no movement frequencies were increased from 12.8 to 40.8%, rapid switching between plus-  and minus end&#x02013;directed ES was readily observed, similar  to control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, A and B). Within 2.6 s, single virus  particles were frequently switching from &#x0002b;0.4 &#x003bc;m/s to  &#x02212;0.4 &#x003bc;m/s and vice versa, suggesting that stable MTs supported rapid bidirectional transport. </p><p>In a number of cultured cells, including polarized cells,  MTs can be detached from the MTOC and may occur as  migrating antiparallel structures with free minus and plus  ends at steady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Keating et al., 1997</xref>). We  therefore tested if the rapid switching between minus- and  plus end&#x02013;directed motions of wt Ad2 occurred near the  MTOC in TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP cells that were reestablishing MTs after nocodazole wash out. Such cells are expected to have a minimal amount of MTs that are not  anchored to the MTOC. As indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> C, a perinuclear MT aster formed after 1&#x02013;2 min of nocodazole wash  out. MTOC-near viruses were observed to switch between  plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed motions at ES of 0.3&#x02013;0.4  &#x003bc;m/s as indicated by a typical particle trace (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> C). Although these amplitudes were somewhat smaller than  those in the control or the taxol-treated cells, they were  significantly larger than the randomly directed mean ES in  nocodazole-treated HeLa (0.15 and 0.17 &#x003bc;m/s, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>) or  TC7 cells (data not shown). We thus concluded that single  cytosolic Ad2 particles were able to engage with both plus-  and minus end&#x02013;directed motors and thus move bidirectionally along not highly dynamic MTs.</p></sec><sec><title>Dynein/Dynactin Significantly Contributes to Minus  End&#x02013;directed Transport of Cytosolic Ad2</title><p>The major minus end&#x02013;directed motor complex of interphase cells is cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">Vallee and Sheetz, 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Hirokawa, 1998</xref>). The motor activity can be experimentally dislodged from cargo by overexpression of p50/dynamitin, a component of the dynein-associated dynactin  complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>). We therefore tested if transient overexpression of human dynamitin in HeLa cells affected  nuclear targeting of Ad2. Control cells transfected with  eGFP-encoding plasmid DNA showed efficient nuclear  targeting of TR-labeled Ad2 at 60 min p.i. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A, panels a&#x02013;c). HeLa cells cotransfected with GFP and dynamitin  plasmids showed reduced nuclear targeting of Ad2, particularly at high levels of overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, panels  d&#x02013;f). At moderate dynamitin overexpressions, variable  levels of nuclear targeting occurred, perhaps due to incomplete inactivation of the dynactin complex. </p><p>To test if dynamitin overexpression interfered with Ad2  escape from endosomes, we assayed the release of cointernalized fluid-phase dextran-FITC from endosomes to the  cytosol upon Ad2 infection in a qualitative assay, similar  to the HRP assay described in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B. To reliably determine the endpoint distribution of the dextran we used a  lysine-fixable 10-kD dextran, which readily diffuses from  the cytosol to the nucleus. Wt Ad2 and, as a control, the  mutant ts1 were bound to control cells or cells overexpressing dynamitin and internalized in the presence of  dextran for 15 min, followed by a 15-min chase in the absence of dextran. About 80% of the cells infected with wt  virus showed a prominent diffuse dextran pattern in the  cytosol and the nucleus, independent of dynamitin overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B, panels a&#x02013;c). Similar results were obtained with a control plasmid overexpressing the loop 1 region of the hexon protein (see Materials and Methods)  (data not shown). In contrast, none of the more than 200  analyzed cells infected with ts1 virus showed any diffuse  cytoplasmic or nuclear dextran staining, but contained numerous punctuate FITC signals in the cytoplasm indicative  of endosomes or lysosomes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B, panels d&#x02013;f). These  results were in full agreement with the HRP fluid-phase  uptake experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B) and suggested that dynamitin overexpression did not appreciably affect Ad2 release from endosomes.</p><p>To quantitate the effects of dynamitin overexpression  on Ad2 trafficking, we compared the extents and frequencies of the minus and plus end&#x02013;directed ES in dynamitin  overexpressing HeLa cells with control and nocodazole-treated cells. Virus motility at the cell surface was, in addition, determined to account for cytosol-independent particle motion. As shown by an ES population analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  B) and exemplified by representative particle traces (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  A), dynamitin overexpression significantly reduced the extents and also the frequencies of the minus end&#x02013;directed  ES. The mean minus end&#x02013;directed speed of 0.22 &#x003bc;m/s  was significantly smaller than the plus end&#x02013;directed mean  speed of 0.30 &#x003bc;m/s (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>), resulting in a plus  end&#x02013;directed population speed of 0.06 &#x003bc;m/s compared  with a minus end&#x02013;directed speed of 0.03 &#x003bc;m/s in control  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B, panels a and b) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). As pointed out  earlier, not all minus end&#x02013;directed transport of Ad2 was  blocked by dynamitin overexpression. This was illustrated  also by the maximal minus end&#x02013;directed ES (&#x0223c;2 &#x003bc;m/s)  and a mean minus end speed, which was significantly  higher than in nocodazole-treated cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). This result may either reflect the heterogenous expression levels  of dynamitin or, alternatively, indicate some form of dynein/dynactin-independent minus end transport of Ad2. In  contrast to the effect of dynamitin on the minus end migration of Ad2, dynamitin overexpression did not significantly affect the mean plus end&#x02013;directed velocity, as illustrated by the predominantly peripheral virus localization  in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, panel b<sub>2</sub>) (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>  and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). However, dynamitin overexpression significantly  increased the frequency of plus end motions to 31.5 from  25.5% in control cells or 25.8% in GFP-expressing cells  (legend of Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>, chi square test at 95% confidence). Interestingly, dynamitin overexpression also significantly increased the fraction of immobile particles to 50.9 from  41.4% in control cells. The validity of our chi square analysis and of the sample volumes were confirmed by the fact  that there were no significant differencies between the  plus, the minus, and the no movement frequencies in control HeLa cells compared with GFP-expressing HeLa  cells. That the expression of GFP had no significant effects  on Ad2 trafficking was further supported by the observation that the mean minus- and plus end&#x02013;directed speeds  were identical in GFP-expressing cells and control cells  (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>, one-sided <italic>t</italic> test, 95% confidence). </p><p>Taken together, the data show that dynamitin overexpression strongly affected but not completely blocked minus end&#x02013;directed transport of cytosolic Ad2. It increased  the frequency of plus end movements and supported long-range movements over several micrometers towards the  periphery. In contrast, no long-range movements, either  MTOC- or periphery-directed, were observed in nocodazole-treated cells. In these cells, short-range random  movements (covering areas of 5&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) with mean  speeds of 0.15 &#x003bc;m/s were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, panel c) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). The motilities in nocodazole-treated cells were apparently randomly directed without any significant difference between plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed mean speeds  (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>). These motilities were, however, not an artefact  of our experimental set up, since they were significantly  larger than the motilities of surface-bound virus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, A  and B, panels d) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>). Possibly, in nocodazole-treated  cells viruses were either moving on short MT fragments  resistant to the drug, or they were using some MT-independent form of intracellular motility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have analyzed the dynamic properties of  incoming Ad2 at various stages of entry. Our results identify the major minus end&#x02013;directed motor complex, dynein/ dynactin, as a key mediator of nuclear targeting of Ad2.  The data support the notion that the viral DNA remains  wrapped by the capsid until arrival at the nuclear membrane. Capsids therefore are expected to contain all the  necessary information for nuclear targeting. Virus particles on the cell surface remain apparently immobile, probably bound to a primary receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bergelson et al., 1997</xref>).  They are then captured into endosomes, penetrate the endosomal membrane, and then move as naked cytosolic  particles along MTs to the MTOC. Our dynamic analysis  at a resolution of up to one frame per second shows that  minus end migration occurs stepwise with maximal ES of  2.6 &#x003bc;m/s, occasionally interrupted by periods of almost  equally fast plus end&#x02013;directed motions or periods of stalling. Consequently, the population speeds towards the  MTOC are in the order of micrometers per minute, in  agreement with the observation that wt virus starts to accumulate at the MTOC and the nuclear envelope at 30&#x02013;40  min p.i. In contrast to wt virus, the endosomal escape-defective mutant virus ts1 does not end up near the perinuclear MTOC, but remains randomly distributed in the  cytoplasm, despite the fact that it undergoes fast minus-  and plus end&#x02013;directed elementary motion steps.</p><sec><title>Cytosolic, but Not Endosomal Virus, Is Transported to  the MTOC</title><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that cytosolic rather  than endosomal viruses are transported to the MTOC.  First, MT depolymerization with nocodazole effectively  inhibited wt virus transport to the nuclear envelope and  left capsids in the cytosol. These cytosolic capsids contain  genomic DNA and are competent to translocate to the nuclear envelope and release their DNA into the nucleus if  MTs are restored. Interestingly, microinjected viral DNA  core structures lacking the remainder capsid components  were not imported into the nucleus, but instead remained  aggregated in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These results show that cytosolic capsid structures and intact  MTs are of functional importance to nuclear import of viral DNA.</p><p>The second evidence favoring transport of naked rather  than endosomal viruses to the MTOC is based on the different dynamic properties of wt virus compared with the  endosomal ts1 mutant. Whereas wt Ad2 moves predominantly to the MTOC with population mean speeds between 0.03 and 0.21 &#x003bc;m/s (depending on the cell type),  plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed movements occur with about  equal frequencies and extents in the case of the mutant ts1.  Ts1-positive vesicles contain fluid-phase endocytic markers, such as HRP or fluorescent dextran indicating that  they were of endocytic origin. Unlike transferrin-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Daro et al., 1996</xref>) ts1 did not accumulate  near the MTOC within 60 min p.i., suggesting that the ts1  vesicles are perhaps routed towards lysosomes rather than  a perinuclear recycling compartment. In accordance with  this possibility, ts1 was degraded in a lysosomal protease-dependent manner starting at &#x0223c;60 min p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Greber et al.,  1996</xref>). MTs are, however, involved in ts1 trafficking, since  nocodazole largely inhibited long-range ts1 movements  (data not shown). Like in the case of wt virus, dynamic  MTs are not required for ts1 motility. Elimination of the  most dynamic MTs by taxol not only increased the mean  minus- and plus end&#x02013;directed speeds of ts1, but also increased the frequency of no movements, thus supporting  the notion that dynamic MTs may facilitate establishing  MT contact with cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Goodson et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Nature of Ad2 Movements through the Cytosol</title><p>The analysis of intracellular wt virus dynamics in nondrug-treated cells shows that between 12.8 and 41.4% of the elementary motion steps were less than 0.1 &#x003bc;m/s depending  on the cell line. This was below the resolution of our set up  and was therefore scored as no movement. Almost all the  particles were, however, closely associated with MTs as  suggested by confocal microscopy and earlier EM studies  (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Luftig and Weihing, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Weatherbee  et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Miles et al., 1980</xref>). It is therefore possible that  cytosolic virus first attaches to MTs and remains immobile  until some motor-dependent transport happens. Transport  to the MT minus ends (or to a lesser extent also the plus  ends) occurred by two types of motion, a slow transport  mode working at micrometers per minute and a fast mode  working at micrometers per second. Both modes are made  up of numerous ES with peak speeds in the order of 0.5&#x02013; 2.6 &#x003bc;m/s. The fast mode is reminiscent of vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Presley et al., 1998</xref>) and typically lasted for several  seconds resulting in efficient virus advancement to the  MTOC. It is not interrupted by stalling or plus end&#x02013; directed motions. Unlike the fast mode, the slow mode can  last for minutes and is composed of alternating minus- and  plus end&#x02013;directed ES, which are typically less than 0.5 &#x003bc;m/s  in magnitude. Since these motions often follow a quasi-linear track and are completely eliminated in the presence  of nocodazole, they are most likely mediated by MT-dependent motors.</p><p>Rapid switching between plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed  motions is not only detected in nondrug-treated cells, but  also in taxol-incubated cells and, importantly, in cells  recovering from nocodazole treatment immediately after  drug wash out. In the latter case, most of the MTs that  were not anchored to the MTOC, including antiparallel  MTs, are expected to be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Keating et al., 1997</xref>).  We therefore concluded that a single Ad2 particle engages  with both plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed motor activities.  The ability to use both types of motors might be important for Ad entry into polarized cells or, possibly, for virus egress from infected polarized or nonpolarized cells.  Whether, and if so, how the motor activities are coordinated is subject of future studies. Besides motor regulation, MTs and associated proteins could have a potential  role in determinating the directionality of transport. Interestingly, both the mean and also the peak periphery-directed speeds of wt Ad2 and endosomal mutant virus  were significantly decreased in cells overexpressing the  MT-binding domain of MAP4 compared with the parental  cells. Whether this effect is related to the observed increase in MT stability in the MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP&#x02013;expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Nguyen et al., 1997</xref>) is not known.</p><p>MT-dependent transport of cargo can, in principle, be  driven by the energetics of plus end MT depolymerization  and dynamic attachment of the motor to the shortening filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Waters and Salmon, 1996</xref>). Our data with taxol-stabilized MTs show that highly dynamic MTs are not required for long-range Ad2 transport. Dynamic MTs may,  however, increase the probability of virus contact with  MTs, since taxol strongly increased the fraction of nonmotile viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Dynein/Dynactin Is a Major Minus End&#x02013;directed Motor  for Ad2</title><p>Like other MT-based motors, the major minus end&#x02013;directed  motor dynein produces directed movement by a conformational change upon ATP-hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Howard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Hirokawa, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Hirokawa et al., 1998</xref>). Dynein is a protein  complex of three different subunits of various stoichiometries translocating along MTs at speeds faster than 0.5 &#x003bc;m/s  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Schroer, 1996</xref>). Dynein attaches to cargo, such as cellular  vesicles and mitotic chromosomes via the dynactin complex. Overexpression of the dynactin component dynamitin has been shown to disrupt the dynactin complex on  the kinetochore of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Echeverri et al.,  1996</xref>) and also affect vesicular trafficking in interphase  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>). Our results show that overexpression of human dynamitin significantly inhibits nuclear targeting of Ad2 in HeLa cells and,  to a lesser extent, also in monkey TC7 cells (data not  shown). It is unlikely that dynamitin overexpression inhibited Ad2 penetration, since a fluid-phase endocytic marker  is delivered to the cytosol upon Ad2 infection, independent of dynamitin overexpression. Accordingly, general  receptor-mediated endocytic uptake is known to occur  without intact MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Rickard and  Kreis, 1996</xref>). Although not all minus end&#x02013;directed transport of wt virus was blocked in the presence of excess dynamitin, our data imply that some component of the  dynactin complex directly or indirectly interacts with cytosolic Ad2 capsid. Owing to the linearity of the remaining  minus end&#x02013;directed movements, this motility is unlikely  caused by Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Beckerle and Porter, 1982</xref>).  It rather reflects either some dynein/dynactin-independent,  but MT-dependent motor activity or, possibly, the heterogenous expression levels of dynamitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Burkhardt et  al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, dynamitin overexpression significantly increased the frequencies of no movements and of  plus end&#x02013;directed movements, which could suggest that a  plus end&#x02013;directed motor attaches to a site on the virus or  even on a dynactin component, which is normally occupied by dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Blangy et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>With the advent of increasingly detailed models of motor interactions with MTs for kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Woehlke et al.,  1997</xref>) and dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Gee et al., 1997</xref>) and increasing structural understanding of kinesin's directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Case et al.,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Henningsen and Schliwa, 1997</xref>), a more detailed  knowledge of the mechanism of dynein motor directionality and interactions with simple cargo is desired. We already know much about the cell biology of motors involved in vesicular transport, such as dynein's role in  trafficking of the intermediate compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Presley et al.,  1997</xref>), Golgi vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Fath et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Holleran et al.,  1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lippincott-Schwartz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Vaisberg et al., 1996</xref>),  mature phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Blocker et al., 1997</xref>), and endosomes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aniento et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Goodson et al., 1997</xref>), but we know  very little about MT-dependent trafficking of nonmembranous organelles or of viral structures. Owing to its relative simplicity and high entry efficiency, Ad offers yet  another opportunity to get additional insights into the  complex regulation of polarized cytoplasmic trafficking. In  addition, any successful application of gene transfer protocols requires overcoming of numerous subcellular barriers  including the cytoplasm. Our present study, together with  a recent report on Herpes virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Sodeik et al., 1997</xref>), indicates that DNA viruses can overcome the cytoplasmic barrier by packaging their genomes into a capsid structure,  which is capable of using the minus end&#x02013;directed MT-dependent dynein motor.</p><p>Our present study is the first dynamic and functional  analysis of an incoming viral structure. It demonstrates  that individual Ad2 particles engage not only with a minus  end&#x02013;directed motor for DNA delivery into the nucleus,  but also interact with a fast plus end&#x02013;directed activity  working at micrometer per second speeds. In HeLa and  TC7 cells, the plus end&#x02013;directed motions are of lower efficiency than the minus end motions, allowing nuclear  targeting of virus at population speeds in the order of  micrometers per minute. It is likely that long-range cytoplasmic motility of nucleic acids generally requires some  form of active transport as demonstrated also for mRNAs  in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bassell and Singer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gr&#x000fc;nert and St.  Johnston, 1996</xref>). For optimal efficiency of future synthetic  or semisynthetic nucleic acid delivery systems viral and/or  cellular elements may therefore be used to facilitate directional movement through the cytoplasm.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ad2 targeting to  the nucleus requires physiological temperature.

ES were calculated from the elementary motion steps of selected virus particles that were located well within the cell and were able to move  in at least five subsequent frames over a minimal distance of 0.5 &#x003bc;m. ES were grouped according to their directionalities, MTOC (minus end), periphery (plus end), and no motility  (0), and characterized in terms of peak speeds, mean speeds, and frequencies. The no motility category comprised movements of less than 0.1 &#x003bc;m/s, which was within the systematic error of our measurements. The total amounts of ES was between 448 and 1,677 and derived from three to seven independent experiments analyzing 13&#x02013;32 different virus particles in 3&#x02013;13 different cells, respectively. The mean plus- and minus end&#x02013;directed speeds including the standard deviations were determined by averaging the corresponding mean  velocities of individual particles. Total mean speeds (representing the population speeds) including the standard deviations were calculated for each particle that was traced. Minus  values represent MTOC-directed speeds, positive values are periphery-directed speeds. (For significant differences between different mean speeds, see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TII">II</xref>.)  Movement frequencies were different in all cases listed above, except in the following instances (as analyzed in a chi square test). With wt Ad2: HeLa control versus HeLa GFP  (peripheral, MTOC, and no motility); TC7 control versus TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP (peripheral speeds); TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP taxol versus HeLa control or HeLa GFP (peripheral  and MTOC speeds). With ts1 Ad2: TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP control versus TC7/MAP4/MTB&#x02013;GFP taxol (periphery, MTOC).                      &#x000a0;</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap
