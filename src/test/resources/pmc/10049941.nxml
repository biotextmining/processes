We have previously reported that CHS to  dinitrofluorobenzene in mice is mediated by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class  I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. In this study, we show that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells mediate the skin inflammation through their cytotoxic activity. The contribution of specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  (CTLs) to the CHS reaction was examined both in vivo and in vitro, using mice deficient in  perforin and/or  Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathways involved in cytotoxicity. Mice double deficient  in perforin and FasL were able to develop hapten-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the lymphoid organs but did not show CHS reaction. However, they did not generate hapten-specific CTLs,  demonstrating that the CHS reaction is dependent on cytotoxic activity. In contrast, Fas-deficient <italic>lpr</italic> mice, FasL-deficient <italic>gld</italic> mice, and perforin-deficient mice developed a normal CHS  reaction and were able to generate hapten-specific CTLs, suggesting that CHS requires either  the Fas/FasL or the perforin pathway. This was confirmed by in vitro studies showing that the  hapten-specific CTL activity was exclusively mediated by MHC class I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  which could use either the perforin or the Fas/FasL pathway for their lytic activity. Thus, cytotoxic CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, commonly implicated in the host defence against tumors and viral infections, could also mediate harmful delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytotoxic T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>contact hypersensitivity</kwd><kwd>contact dermatitis</kwd><kwd>hapten</kwd><kwd>dinitrofluorobenzene</kwd><kwd>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Contact hypersensitivity (CHS)<sup>1</sup> is a T cell&#x02013;mediated  cutaneous inflammatory reaction occurring after epicutaneous exposure to haptens in sensitized individuals (1&#x02013; 3). In humans, it frequently manifests as an inflammatory  dermatosis referred to as contact dermatitis. Haptens are  low molecular weight chemicals which covalently bind to  discrete amino acid residues on self or exogenous proteins  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The sensitization phase, also referred to as the afferent  phase, occurs after the first contact of the skin with the  hapten. Hapten-modified proteins are loaded onto dendritic epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) which migrate from  the epidermis to the regional draining LNs, where priming  of hapten-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).  The elicitation phase, also known as the efferent phase, develops within a few hours after subsequent contact with the  hapten, and is mediated by the activation of hapten-specific  T cells in the skin.</p><p>For many years, CHS was considered, like classical delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), to be mediated by  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that  CHS to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) was mediated by  IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells only, whereas CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells downregulate this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Thus, CHS can be  considered as an antigen-specific inflammation mediated by  hapten-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which differs from classical  DTH to protein antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Although haptens are potent inducers of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), it is not known  whether CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells mediate the skin inflammation through  such cytotoxic activity or through the secretion of type 1  cytokines.</p><p>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs are major effector cells of the immune defence system against viruses and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and exert their  lytic functions through two main independent mechanisms  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The secretory pathway involves the release of perforin and granzymes from cytolytic granules. The nonsecretory pathway involves interaction of the FasL upregulated during T cell activation, with the apoptosis-inducing  Fas molecule on the target cell.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the contribution of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity to the pathophysiology of  CHS, using mice deficient in the Fas/FasL pathway (<italic>lpr</italic>  and <italic>gld</italic> mice), the perforin pathway (perforin-deficient [P<sup>0/0</sup>]  mice), and in both cytolytic pathways (P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice).

Since the CHS reaction to DNFB is  associated with the infiltration of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cells in situ a few hours after challenge (Akiba, H.,  manuscript in preparation), we examined the presence of  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and the expression of IFN-&#x003b3; in the skin of  P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> and C57BL/6 mice after sensitization and challenge  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). PCR analysis demonstrated that CD8 and IFN-&#x003b3;  mRNAs were not found in the skin of naive mice or in  hapten-painted ears of unsensitized mice. In contrast, upregulation of both CD8 and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA occurred as  early as 6 h after challenge in both C57BL/6 and P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic>  mice, indicating that lack of both perforin and FasL did not  affect the migration of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to the skin. However,  at 24 and 48 h after challenge, dramatic differences were  noted. C57BL/6 mice showed a gradual increase in the intensity of the CD8 and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA expression, whereas  no signal was observed in the skin of P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice. These  results suggest that DNFB-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from P<sup>0/0</sup>  <italic>gld</italic> mice are able to migrate from blood to skin, but cannot  induce the specific signals necessary for the constitution of  the inflammatory cellular infiltrate. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>DNFB-specific CHS and CTL Responses Develop in Lpr  Mice, Gld Mice, and P<sup>0/0</sup> Mice.</title><p>To determine the relative  contribution of the Fas/FasL and perforin pathways to the  CHS response, we tested the ability of Fas-deficient (<italic>lpr</italic>),  FasL-deficient (<italic>gld</italic>), and P<sup>0/0</sup> mice to exhibit specific CHS  and CTL responses after DNFB sensitization.</p><p>In marked contrast to double-deficient P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice, <italic>lpr</italic>,  <italic>gld</italic>, or P<sup>0/0</sup> mice developed a normal CHS reaction to  DNFB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> a), with intensity, kinetics, and histological  characteristics comparable to those observed in C57BL/6  mice.

MHC class I molecules were mandatory for the  induction, expansion, and effector function of specific  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs, since: (a) primed spleen cells from C57BL/6  and II<sup>0/0</sup>, but not from I<sup>0/0</sup>, mice could lyse haptenated targets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> a); (b) hapten-specific lysis was not observed  when effector cells were restimulated in vitro with haptenated APCs from I<sup>0/0</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> b); and (c) CTL activity of  C57BL/6 spleen cells was suppressed by incubation with  mAbs to the K<sup>b</sup> MHC class I molecules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> c). These  results indicate that the hapten-specific CTLs are &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d;  MHC class I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. </p><p>The contribution of perforin or Fas/FasL to the CTL activity was tested using perforin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (from C57BL/6 mice) and  perforin-deficient (from P<sup>0/0</sup> mice) effectors and targets  comprising Fas<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (MBL2-Fas) and Fas-deficient (MBL2)  cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> d, perforin-deficient effectors  could lyse hapten-treated Fas<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, but not Fas-deficient  cells, whereas perforin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs were able to lyse Fas-deficient cells as efficiently as Fas-expressing cells. Thus, hapten-specific MHC class I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CTLs could use  the Fas/FasL or the perforin pathway for their CTL activity, which could be abolished only by inactivation of both  cytolytic pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells require cytotoxic activity to mediate CHS. The invalidation of the two  main cytolytic pathways, as observed in mice deficient in  perforin and FasL (P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic>), is responsible for the lack of  generation of specific CTLs and for the abolition of the  CHS reaction. Interestingly, the presence of a single cytolytic pathway, in <italic>lpr</italic> mice, <italic>gld</italic> mice, and P<sup>0/0</sup> mice, is sufficient for the development of a CHS reaction and for the  priming of specific CTLs, indicating that the Fas/FasL and  the perforin pathways could be used independently and  with similar efficiency for cytolytic activity. These results  are in line with recent data on influenza virus infection  showing that virus clearance by CTLs could be achieved  only if one of the two main lytic pathways remained functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Until our study, cytokines, and especially IFN-&#x003b3; and  TNF-&#x003b1;, were thought to mediate skin inflammation through  their ability to activate keratinocytes and endothelial cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Recent studies excluded a pivotal role for IFN-&#x003b3;  in the elicitation phase of CHS, since IFN-&#x003b3; receptor&#x02013;deficient mice developed a normal CHS reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In addition, studies in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;deficient mice indicated that the  cytokine was not involved in the elicitation phase but  played an important role in the sensitization phase by inducing the emigration of LCs to the draining LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>CHS develops in two phases, the sensitization (i.e., afferent) phase leading to the priming of hapten-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cells and the elicitation (i.e., efferent) phase occurring after challenge and leading to the development of skin inflammation. MHC class I molecules expressed by LCs are  mandatory for the priming of hapten-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  in the LNs during the afferent phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). These MHC  class I&#x02013;restricted CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells exert CHS through CTL  activity using classical cytolytic pathways. That cytotoxicity  is the effector mechanism responsible for the efferent phase  of CHS is supported by the observation that hapten-primed, IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are present in  lymphoid organs of P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice and respond vigorously in  secondary proliferative responses, demonstrating that the  lack of CHS reaction is not due to an impairment of the  sensitization phase of CHS, but rather reflects an alteration  during the elicitation phase.</p><p>The mechanisms involved in the development of skin  inflammation upon challenge in sensitized mice, i.e., during the elicitation phase, associates hapten-specific and  nonspecific steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). First, lymphocytes have to emigrate  from the blood to the skin. Infiltration of the skin by  mononuclear cells has been reported to occur within a few  hours after challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Haptens are able to directly induce expression of E- and P-selectins on endothelial cells 2 h  after skin painting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). It is thought that circulating  antigen-specific memory T cells which carry homing receptors (the cutaneous leukocyte-associated antigen [CLA]  molecule) are able to enter the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) through interaction with P- and E-selectins expressed on endothelial cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Second, specific T cells are activated on hapten presentation by skin-resident cells, as revealed by detection of  IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA in situ between 4 and 8 h after challenge  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Third, activation of skin-resident cells by T cell  cytokines results in the amplification of the inflammatory  reaction leading to the cellular inflammatory infiltrate.  Upon IFN-&#x003b3; activation, keratinocytes upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and Ia molecules  and produce a wide array of inflammatory cytokines and  chemokines such as IL-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Likewise, endothelial cell activation is followed by leukocyte migration  from the blood vessels to the dermis, leading to the formation of inflammatory cellular infiltrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). In this  scheme, the hapten-specific limb of the CHS reaction corresponds to the activation of hapten-specific T cells and occurs &#x0223c;6 h after challenge, whereas the nonspecific phase  corresponds to the infiltration of the skin by the polymorphic cellular infiltrate, which peaks 24 h after challenge.</p><p>It appears from our data that the failure of P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice  to exhibit a CHS reaction is not due to the inability of  CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to infiltrate the skin or to be activated, since  IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could be detected in the  skin 6 h after challenge, at levels comparable to those found  in C57BL/6 mice. However, these early parameters of the  CHS reaction were not followed by an increase in cellular  infiltration in situ, as observed in C57BL/6 mice at 24 and  48 h. These observations suggest that cytolytic function of  hapten-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells is required for the recruitment of inflammatory cells and full development of the  CHS response. Both epidermal dendritic LCs and keratinocytes express MHC class I molecules and may produce  upon activation (or lethal hit) a wide array of inflammatory  cytokines and chemokines. Destruction of haptenated LCs  by CTLs may account for the recent observation that LCs  undergo apoptotic cell death in CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Alternatively,  keratinocytes, which represent &#x0003e;90% of epidermal cells,  could be the targets of antihapten CTLs, the more so since  IFN-&#x003b3;, produced in situ during the course of CHS, upregulates Fas expression by keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CHS to DNFB  is mediated by hapten-specific CTLs which may use either  the Fas/FasL or the perforin pathway for the induction of  cutaneous inflammation. The precise nature of the MHC  class I&#x02013;expressing skin cells able to present the hapten to  CTLs in vivo during the elicitation phase is currently under  investigation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CHS to DNFB is impaired in P<sup>0/0</sup> <italic>gld</italic> mice.
