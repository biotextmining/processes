Could an organ be removed with a laparoscope, should it be removed, and, more importantly, by what manner should it be removed?&#x02014; questions without ready answers. And so, major laparoscopic surgery remained out of general surgical consciousness.</p><p>There were those, however, including M&#x000fc;he, Mouret, Dubois, P&#x000e9;rissat and others, who thought that laparoscopic cholecystectomy was feasible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> In this country, a gynecologist, William Saye, collaborated with general surgeon Barry McKernan to perform the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Reddick and Olsen soon followed with their series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></sup></p><p>The progenitors of the laparoscopic revolution were few, but they were articulate, and the public was receptive. Saye, McKernan, Reddick and Olsen preached the new gospel that gallbladders could be removed laparoscopically with less hospitalization, and dramatically less pain. Word spread quickly.</p><p>Back in 1990, it was a new world, bright and shiny. &#x0201c;Band-Aid surgery&#x0201d; was proclaimed by the media, and demand for laparoscopic surgery became, in part, patient driven. The early pioneers spearheaded by Saye, McKernan, Reddick and Olsen set up training centers and courses to teach classically trained surgeons laparoscopic and laser techniques.</p><p>State-of-the-art 1990's imaging technology was harnessed to visualize a diseased organ. Special instruments were conceived to manipulate these organs. Laparoscopic sutures and loops were refined along with clip appliers, staples, tackers and gastrointestinal staplers. Perhaps the most important of these developments was the laparoscopic clip applier, for this humble instrument gave inexperienced general surgeons the confidence that ducts and blood vessels could be quickly secured. Once this confidence was established, all else followed.</p><p>The early teachers and trainees in laparoscopy felt a sense of collegiality with one another. They believed they were part of a historical watershed in surgical thought and waged a crusade for laparoscopic general surgery. Ideas and strategies were shared. New techniques were applied to old problems: appendectomy, hernia repair, hysterectomy, nephrectomy and gastrointestinal procedures in short order were approached laparoscopically. A revolution exploded in surgery. Laparoscopy was not just a different method of access, but represented a different mindset on how to approach a general surgical problem.</p><fig id="FU1" position="float"><caption><p>SLS Chairman, Dr. Paul Alan Wetter (right) and Immediate Past President, Dr. Michael S.

William Saye and J. Barry McKernan to receive the prestigious EXCEL award. These pioneers were chosen for their ground-breaking role in the development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the teaching of this procedure to thousands of surgeons.</p><p>These physicians, a gynecologist and a general surgeon, exemplified the cooperation between specialties championed by SLS. Together, they helped show that laparoscopic cholecystectomy was possible&#x02014;not only possible, but practical and efficient. It represented a significant advance in the art of surgery. With Reddick, Olsen and others, they demonstrated the collegiality that would help gather critical mass and directly result in the explosion of laparoscopic surgery.</p><fig id="FU2" position="float"><caption><p>1992 EXCEL Award winner, Professor Kurt Semm (left) congratulates Dr. William Saye (right) on his and Dr. J.
