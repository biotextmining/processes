Neefjes. 1997. <italic>Eur. J. Immunol.</italic> 27: 2441&#x02013;2449). Our studies show that CRT preparations purified from tumors elicit specific immunity to the tumor used as the source of CRT but not to an antigenically distinct tumor. The  immunogenicity is attributed to the peptides associated with the CRT molecule and not to the  CRT molecule per se. It is further shown that CRT molecules can be complexed in vitro to  unglycosylated peptides and used to elicit peptide-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell response in spite of exogenous administration. These characteristics of CRT closely resemble those of HSPs gp96,  hsp90, and hsp70, although CRT has no apparent structural homologies to them.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>stress protein</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic T  lymphocyte response</kwd><kwd>cancer immunity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Peptide-binding heat shock proteins (HSPs)<sup>1</sup> of the cytosol (hsp70, hsp90) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  (gp96) have been shown to elicit antigen-specific cellular  immunity to tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), viral antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), minor histocompatibility antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), and model antigens  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) expressed by the cells from which the HSPs are  isolated. The basis of the general ability of HSP preparations to immunize specifically lies in the observation that  hsp70, hsp90, and gp96 are associated with a broad repertoire of peptides, including the antigenic peptides generated in any given cell or tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Immunogenic  HSP&#x02013;peptide complexes can also be reconstituted in vitro  by complexing a given peptide with hsp70 or gp96 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The mechanism through which HSP&#x02013;peptide complexes elicit peptide-specific immunity has been partially  elucidated: HSP&#x02013;peptide complexes are taken up by professional APCs and the peptides are processed and re-presented on the surface of the APC by the MHC I molecules  of the APC, which then stimulate antigen-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>The physiological function of the HSP&#x02013;peptide complexes within the cells of origin is unclear. It has been proposed that HSPs constitute a relay-line of chaperones that  transport peptides from the point of their generation in the  cytosol to their being loaded onto the MHC I molecules in  the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Specifically, hsp90 and hsp70, the most abundant cytosolic chaperones, have been proposed to transport  peptides to the heterodimeric transporters associated with  antigen processing (TAPs), whereas gp96, a major chaperone of the lumen of the ER, has been proposed to facilitate  assembly of the MHC I&#x02013;&#x003b2;2 microglobulin&#x02013;peptide complexes in the ER. Recent studies by Spee and Neefjes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)  have shown that TAP-transported peptides associate with  gp96, and indicate that another ER-resident chaperone,  calreticulin (CRT), is a recipient of the TAP-transported  glycosylated peptides. The studies reported here were undertaken to test whether CRT would, by virtue of its peptide-binding ability and because it is an HSP, elicit tumor  immunity if purified from tumor cells, and peptide-specific  immunity if complexed with antigenic peptides in vitro.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice and Antibodies.</title><p>BALB/cJ and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="jackson">Jackson Laboratory</named-content>.

The  two proteins were recognized by the respective antibodies  on immunoblots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As CRT has a mol wt very similar to two other chaperones, PDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and Erp57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>),  CRT preparations were immunoblotted with antibodies to  each, as described in Materials and Methods. Although the  antibodies recognized the cognate proteins in control blots,  neither antibody detected a corresponding protein in purified CRT preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). BALB/cJ mice were immunized twice at weekly intervals with a 20-&#x003bc;g dose of  purified gp96 or an equimolar dose (11 &#x003bc;g and a lower  dose of 5.5 &#x003bc;g) of CRT and were challenged with 100,000  live Meth A cells 1 wk after the second immunization. Tumors grew progressively in all buffer-immunized mice, but  mice immunized with the Meth A&#x02013;gp96 or Meth A&#x02013;CRT  preparation were equally protected from tumor growth.  The immunogenicity of CRT was dose dependent, as mice  immunized with half the effective dose succumbed to tumor challenge. Furthermore, mice immunized with Meth  A&#x02013;CRT were found to be not resistant to challenge with  the antigenically distinct BALB/cJ fibrosarcoma CMS5, indicating the tumor-specificity of immunogenicity of Meth  A&#x02013;CRT. In a further demonstration of specificity, immunization with homogenous preparations of gp96 or CRT  from BALB/cJ mouse liver did not elicit immunity to challenge with Meth A sarcoma at any dose tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).   </p><p>Because Con A chromatography was used in purification  of both gp96 and CRT and because Con A is known to  stimulate monocytes and T lymphocytes, the possibility  that the immunogenicity of CRT and gp96 preparations  observed here derives from a Con A contamination of our  preparations should be considered. Three observations rule  out this possibility: the specificity of immunogenicity of tumor-derived HSP preparations, as has been demonstrated  repeatedly in several studies from our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and  by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) argues against such a nonspecific effect. Furthermore, in a routine, periodic screening of gp96  preparations with anti&#x02013;Con A antibodies over the years,  such contamination has not been observed, nor has inclusion of &#x003b1;-methyl pyranoside in the immunizing preparations reduced the immunogenicity of HSP preparations  (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Association of CRT Molecules with Peptides In Vivo and In  Vitro.</title><p>The immunogenicity of tumor-derived but not  normal tissue&#x02013;derived CRT is reminiscent of similar observations with the HSPs gp96, hsp90, and hsp70. In those instances, the immunogenicity was demonstrated to derive  from HSP-associated peptides and not the HSPs per se.  The possibility that CRT molecules are associated with  peptides was considered. Because CRT is an ATP-binding  protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and as hsp70&#x02013;ATP interaction has been  shown to result in dissociation of peptides from hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>),  the ability of ATP to dissociate peptides from CRT was  tested. It was observed that treatment of homogeneous  preparations of CRT with ATP did not dissociate peptides  from CRT under conditions that led to dissociation of  peptides from hsp70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of  gp96 with ATP also did not result in elution of associated  peptides, although gp96 is an ATP-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).  These observations must be considered with the caveat that  ATP binding by CRT might require conditions other than  those used for hsp70, hsp90, or gp96. Although this possibility is considered unlikely because of the conserved ATP-binding domains present in ATP-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), our  observations do not rule it out. </p><p>The possibility that the peptides bound to CRT in vivo  can be exchanged with exogenous peptides at high temperatures was tested. The procedure shown to be effective  with other HSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) was tested. CRT preparations, and  gp96 preparations as a positive control, were incubated  with radio-iodinated peptide VSV19 (NH<sub>2</sub>-Ser-Leu-Ser-Asp-Leu-<underline>Arg-Gly-Tyr-Val-Tyr-Gln-Gly-Leu</underline>-Ly s-Ser-Asn-Val-Ser-COOH which is extended on the NH<sub>2</sub> and  COOH termini of K<sup>b</sup>-binding VSV nucleocapsid protein  epitope VSV8, underlined) at 25&#x000b0;C, 37&#x000b0;C, or 50&#x000b0;C, followed by 30 min at room temperature. Equimolar quantities of each protein were used so that the molar ratio of  peptide to protein was the same in each lane. The samples  were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie  staining (to determine protein content) and by autoradiography (to determine the bound peptide) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It was observed that CRT associated with exogenous radiolabeled  peptides in a temperature-dependent manner and that  CRT&#x02013;peptide complexes remained stable under conditions  of SDS-PAGE. Quantitative analysis of bound peptides  indicated that under the conditions used for peptide- exchange in vitro, &#x0223c;2% of the CRT molecules received  exogenous peptides at 50&#x000b0;C, and at a lower temperature  such as 37&#x000b0;C only half as many CRT molecules could associate with the exogenous peptide. When gp96 and CRT  were used together, such that they had to compete for the  same pool of peptides under the same conditions, gp96 was  observed to bind peptides two to three times more efficiently than CRT. </p></sec><sec disp-level="4"><title>Generation of VSV-specific CTLs in Mice Immunized with  CRT&#x02013;peptide Complexes Reconstituted In Vitro.</title><p>The ability  of CRT to act as a CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> response-eliciting adjuvant was  tested. The VSV19 peptide was complexed in vitro with  either gp96 or CRT at 50&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. C57BL/6 mice  were immunized with the reconstituted complexes (50 &#x003bc;g  of gp96 or 27.5 &#x003bc;g of CRT complexed with VSV19), or  VSV19 alone, or gp96 or CRT alone without complexing.  Spleen cells of immunized mice were cultured with the  VSV8 and tested for cytotoxic activity on <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled EL4  cells or EL4 pulsed with the VSV8 peptide as targets. It was  observed that spleen cells of mice immunized with CRT&#x02013; peptide complexes showed peptide-specific CTL activity,  whereas splenocytes of mice immunized with peptide or  CRT alone showed no cytotoxic activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similar  results were obtained with gp96&#x02013;peptide complexes. Based  on the quantity of peptides bound to CRT, these results  suggest that &#x0223c;20 ng of VSV19 or 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>12</sup> molecules of  VSV19 coupled to CRT are sufficient to elicit a CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  CTL response. The in vitro complexing studies were carried out with two variations: those where the CRT used  for complexing with peptides was derived from syngeneic  C57BL/6 mice and those where it was derived from allogeneic BALB/cJ mice. It was observed that CRT of either  haplotype could be complexed to VSV19 and could be  used to immunize C57BL/6 mice to elicit an H-2<sup>b</sup>&#x02013; restricted CTL response against VSV8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). </p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CRT is a calcium-binding protein of the ER and has  been shown to be involved in the folding and assembly of  MHC I molecules. Recent observations by Spee and  Neefjes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) demonstrate that peptides transported into the  lumen of the ER by the TAP molecule associate with gp96  as well as with PDI and CRT. That study showed the general ability of CRT to bind to proteins as well as to glycosylated peptides of specific sequences inside lumen of the  ER. Association of CRT with peptides as well as the evidence of CRT to be associated with MHC I molecule during its folding and assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) makes CRT a potential candidate of the relay line of HSPs during antigen  processing and presentation by MHC I molecules, as we  had suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>In our studies, CRT and gp96 bind peptide with comparable efficiency in vitro, when each is tested alone. In a  competition assay, gp96 binds to the longer peptide more  efficiently than CRT, but when gp96 is not present in the  assay, CRT binds to the peptide as efficiently as gp96. Although Spee and Neefjes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) demonstrated that only glycosylated peptides are accepted by CRT in their assay, the  peptide complexed in vitro in the present study is unglycosylated. This suggests either that the requirement for glycosylation of peptides for their acceptance by CRT in the  lumen of the ER is not absolute, or that such apparent requirement is a peculiarity of the assay used in the study of  Spee and Neefjes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The possibility should also be entertained that although CRT has the capacity to bind both  glycosylated and unglycosylated peptides, only glycosylated  peptides are routed to it in vivo, due to the intricacies of  the peptide trafficking from the cytosol to the ER. The fact  that calnexin, a protein related to CRT, is a chaperone for  a wide array of glycosylated integral membrane protein,  and has been defined as a lectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), is consistent with this  possibility. This line of reasoning also raises the question of  whether calnexin, as an integral membrane protein or in a  soluble luminal form, has the capacity for binding peptides  in vivo and the capacity to immunize.</p><p>The mechanism by which CRT&#x02013;peptide complex elicits  immunity is presently unknown. It is conceivable that it is  similar to the mechanism by which gp96&#x02013;peptide complexes elicit immunity, which includes a receptor through  which gp96 is taken up by the professional APCs and the  peptides are re-presented. A crucial question in this regard  is whether this is a common receptor for the HSPs or  whether the mechanisms are different. This is particularly  intriguing since gp96, hsp70, or CRT molecules have no  structural homologies.</p><p>Binding of peptides by CRT provides evidence of the  generality of the peptide-binding property of HSPs and  of the immunogenicity of such HSP&#x02013;peptide complexes.  From an evolutionary perspective, considering the broad  chaperoning function of HSPs and the association of HSPs  with the degradative machinery of cells, this is not surprising. However, it is interesting to note that the hsp70,  hsp90, gp96 and CRT molecules do not share any obvious  sequences or other structural homology. The possibility  that their peptide binding pockets may share conformational similarities despite the lack of structural homology,  clearly exists and will be instructive with regard to evolution of peptide-binding proteins including the MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Our previous observation that complexes of  non-HSPs, such as serum albumin with peptides, do not  elicit peptide-specific CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) suggest that the immunogenicity does not result solely and inevitably from peptide  binding and that the immunogenicity of HSP&#x02013;peptide  complexes is unique, deriving perhaps from specific interaction between HSPs and APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Gp96 and CRT  preparations.
