It offers a powerful  extension to in vitro models that have implicated a requirement for cytochrome c in caspase activation and  apoptosis. We found that an overt alteration in cytochrome c anticipates programmed cell death (PCD) in  <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, occurring at a time that considerably precedes other known indicators of apoptosis. The  altered configuration is manifested by display of an otherwise hidden epitope and occurs without release of the  protein into the cytosol. Conditional expression of the  <italic>Drosophila</italic> death activators, <italic>reaper</italic> or <italic>grim</italic>, provoked  apoptogenic cytochrome c display and, surprisingly,  caspase activity was necessary and sufficient to induce  this alteration. In cell-free studies, cytosolic caspase activation was triggered by mitochondria from apoptotic  cells but identical preparations from healthy cells were  inactive. Our observations provide compelling validation of an early role for altered cytochrome c in PCD  and suggest propagation of apoptotic physiology  through reciprocal, feed-forward amplification involving cytochrome c and caspases.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>programmed cell death</kwd><kwd>cytochrome c</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>A<sc>poptosis,</sc> a genetically mediated suicide mechanism,  is associated with distinctive morphological changes  including membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, chromatin aggregation, and formation of apoptotic  bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">Wyllie et al., 1980</xref>). It is the predominant form of cell death associated with normal cell  turnover and is also the basis of cell killing by some genotoxic agents (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Thompson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Smith and Fornace, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Jacobson et al., 1997</xref>).

Cytochrome c is an essential component of  the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is a soluble protein,  localized in the intermembrane space, and is loosely attached to the surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Gonzales and Neupert, 1990</xref>). It has been observed  that cytochrome c is released from mitochondria into the  cytosol of cultured cells undergoing apoptosis, resulting in  the activation of cysteine proteases, termed caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu  et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kluck et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Reed, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Yang et al.,  1997</xref>). Diverse stimuli which cause apoptosis result in the  activation of caspases which cleave a variety of substrates  including structural components, regulatory proteins, and  other caspases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Nicholson and  Thornberry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Salvesen and Dixit, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">Villa et al.,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cryns and Yuan, 1998</xref>). More recent studies have  shown that microinjection of cytochrome c is sufficient to  induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Zhivotovsky et al., 1998</xref>) and that reconstitution of a purified caspase-3 activation complex requires cytochrome c as an obligate binding factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Li et al.,  1997</xref>). In addition, several reports suggest that <italic>bcl-2</italic>, located primarily on the outer membrane of mitochondria  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Monaghan et al., 1992</xref>), may block apoptosis by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kluck  et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). While several compelling  lines of evidence favor an important role for cytochrome c  in apoptosis, our knowledge in this area comes solely from  in vitro models or cultured cells, where apoptosis is experimentally induced (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Reed, 1997a</xref>).</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> affords a powerful genetic  context to investigate details of cellular and molecular  events in apoptosis which otherwise remain obscure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>). In this animal model, we  detected cytological changes associated with cytochrome c  that precede overt signs of apoptosis, both in live tissues  and in cultured cells. In late-stage egg chambers, nurse  cells transfer their cytoplasmic contents to the developing  oocytes and subsequently undergo apoptotic cell death  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">King, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Tourmente et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Foley and Cooley,  1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">McCall and Steller, 1998</xref>). Cytoplasmic dumping and  the eventual demise of the nurse cells occurs through reproducible stages that provide an excellent model for the  analysis of pre-apoptotic events in identifiable cells. We  examined the status of cytochrome c in vivo using this  model of programmed cell death. Our studies revealed  that a pronounced change in this protein, evidenced by the  exposure of an otherwise hidden epitope (i.e., apoptogenic  display of cytochrome c), precedes overt signs of apoptosis. Display of a new cytochrome c epitope was highly specific for pre-apoptotic cells, and did not occur in cells destined to survive.</p><p>A similar alteration associated with cytochrome c was  detected in the cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells expressing the  known apoptotic activators <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>)<sup>1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">White et al.,  1994</xref>) or <italic>grim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996b</xref>). Consistent with our  studies of ovarian tissues, the altered form of cytochrome c  was specific for apoptotic cells and was not detected in a  variety of controls. Moreover, this change was specific for  apoptotic death because altered cytochrome c did not occur in cells killed by toxic challenge. However, in contrast  to reports from studies of mammalian cells, the apoptogenic form of cytochrome c was not released from mitochondria during apoptosis, but instead remained localized to  this organelle (as evidenced by cell fractionation and cytology). Since apoptosis induced by <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>grim</italic> is caspase  dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Nordstrom et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Pronk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">White et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Kondo et al., 1997</xref>) we also examined the influence of  caspase function upon the altered display of cytochrome c.  The viral caspase inhibitor, p35, and peptide-based caspase inhibitors completely blocked display of the apoptogenic cytochrome c epitope and, conversely, expression of  an activated <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspase was sufficient to trigger  apoptogenic changes in cytochrome c. Finally, in cell-free  studies, we found that mitochondria isolated from apoptotic cells could promote caspase activation whereas identical preparations from healthy cells did not.</p><p>Taken together, we demonstrate that the appearance of  an altered form of cytochrome c selectively precedes the  programmed death of cells in an intact, developing organ.

The same banding pattern was  also observed when immunoprecipitation was performed  using purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c (Liu, J., and R.  Jemmerson, unpublished observation). </p><p>These bands clearly represent distinct cytochrome c species since they were immunoprecipitated with mAbs to the  native protein, and were detected by Western blot using a  different mAb that recognizes a distinct epitope on the denatured protein. While it is formally possible that these  two bands correspond to the polypeptides encoded by the  <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c genes, DC-3 and DC-4, earlier  studies suggest that only DC-4 encodes a functional polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Inoue et al., 1986</xref>) and furthermore, the expected  <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c products (DC-3 and DC-4) differ by only three amino acids, which is not likely to be resolved in our gels. Although the biochemical nature of  these different forms is unresolved, our data indicate that  mAb 2G8 preferentially recognized the higher molecular  weight form of the doublet. This product occurs in relatively small amounts that were not overtly affected by the  extent of apoptosis in the cultures (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Altered Cytochrome c Anticipates Programmed Cell Death</title><p>Between stages 11 and 13 of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, programmed cell death eliminates nurse cells which nourish  the developing egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Sang and King, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Foley and  Cooley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">McCall and Steller, 1998</xref>). The apoptotic nature of nurse cell death is indicated by two distinct markers, acridine orange staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Abrams et al., 1993</xref>) and  TUNEL labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gavrieli et al., 1992</xref>). These readily  identifiable cells offer a unique opportunity to examine  pre-apoptotic events before their eventual demise.</p><p>To directly demonstrate the involvement of cytochrome c  during apoptosis, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries were stained with the  anti&#x02013;cytochrome c mAbs described above and egg chambers at all stages of development were analyzed. In preliminary experiments, mAb 2G8 detected cytochrome c in  apoptotic cells prompting extensive studies with this mAb.  As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, A and B, only nurse cells at stage 10B  exhibited pronounced cytochrome c immunoreactivity distributed as characteristically punctate labeling of the cytoplasm in a pattern consistent with localization to mitochondria (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). Such staining was not seen in  nurse cells before this stage, nor was this overt immunoreactivity seen in any other cell type of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg  chamber. Moreover, this staining was specific for cytochrome c immunoreactivity because no labeling of nurse  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C) was observed if the antibody was first  preadsorbed with cytochrome c covalently bound to Sepharose 4B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Urbanski and Margoliash, 1977</xref>).  </p><p>To determine the chronology of cytochrome c display  relative to other apoptotic changes, we compared the  onset of mAb binding with other degenerative changes  known to occur in these cells. Though nurse cells at stage  10B showed pronounced exposure of the epitope for mAb  2G8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B) no signs of apoptosis were apparent in either the cytoplasm or the nuclei of these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, D  and E). Egg chambers were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin which detects filamentous actin at the  cortices of the nurse cells. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D, this  marker substantiates the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane and shows that nurse cell dumping has not yet begun at a time when cytochrome c labeling is already very  conspicuous. Similarly the nuclei of nurse cells at stage  10B were negative for TUNEL labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> E), a  method that detects a nuclear hallmark of apoptosis. By  stages 12&#x02013;13 (at least 0.5 to 4 h later) the nuclei of the dying nurse cells adopt characteristic apoptotic features as  evidenced by the TUNEL assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> G) and acridine orange staining (data not shown). These results demonstrate  that cytochrome c display precedes overt signs of apoptosis in intact organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Altered Cytochrome c Is Provoked by Apoptosis Activators</title><p>Previous studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> SL2 cells have shown that  conditional expression of <italic>rpr</italic> or <italic>grim</italic> triggers apoptosis in  cultured cells and in transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">White et al., 1994</xref>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Nordstrom et al., 1996</xref>).

It should also be emphasized that  routine labeling of apoptotic SL2 cells (or egg chambers)  with a variety of antibodies directed against different antigens does not behave like mAb 2G8, and we can readily  exclude the possibility that the pre-apoptotic condition  somehow promotes enhanced immunodetection. </p></sec><sec><title>Cytochrome c Is Retained in Mitochondria during Apoptosis</title><p>To test the possibility that cytochrome c might be released  into the cytosol during apoptosis, we fractionated healthy  SL2 cells and apoptotic <italic>rpr</italic>- or <italic>grim</italic>-expressing cells, and  assayed for cytochrome c in the mitochondrial (heavy  membrane) and cytosolic fractions. Surprisingly, these  cells showed no difference in cytochrome c distribution  and we found no evidence for the transit of cytochrome c  to the cytosol as a correlate to apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). It is  worth mentioning that our experimental design is set up  such that equal numbers of cells are plated &#x0223c;18 h before  induction. Therefore, differences between parental and  transfected samples in the levels of cytochrome c (in total  and heavy membrane samples) result solely from differences in growth rate and cell number at the time of harvest  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bose et al., 1998</xref>). Note that reduced levels of immunogen  detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A, lanes 5 and 6) are proportional to the  reduced total levels of immunogen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A, lanes 2 and  3). In addition, we should emphasize that nothing about  our procedure would have prevented us from observing a  genuine change in the subcellular location of this protein  because in several preparations we could, in fact, cause cytochrome c to be released and detected in the cytosol simply by omitting sucrose from the preparation (see Materials and Methods).</p><p>Biochemical data indicating retention of cytochrome c  in mitochondria during apoptosis is consistent with our cytological studies. For instance, under all circumstances the  protein was compartmentalized in a punctate distribution  which, in double labeling experiments, was coincident  with the mitochondrial marker, rhodamine 123 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B).

First, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria occurs as an early response  to a variety of death stimuli, and this release is prevented  by overexpression of bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kim et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kluck et al.,  1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kroemer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Reed, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Yang et al., 1997</xref>).  Second, cytochrome c triggers activation of caspases in  several in vitro models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Kluck et al.,  1997a</xref>,b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">Vaux, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Zou et al., 1997</xref>).  Third, direct injection of cytochrome c into cultured cells  promotes death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">Zhivotovsky et al., 1998</xref>).  Finally, reconstitution of a purified caspase-3 activation  complex was found to require cytochrome c as an obligate  binding factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Li et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>We examined the status of cytochrome c during programmed cell death in an animal model. As part of this effort, we characterized mAbs directed against rat cytochrome c for binding <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c in situ. One  mAb, 2G8, was of particular interest because it exhibited  specific immunoreactivity to cytochrome c only in the mitochondria of cells that are committed to undergo apoptosis. For instance, pronounced labeling for cytochrome c  was observed in mitochondria of cells expressing the apoptosis activators, <italic>rpr</italic> or <italic>grim</italic>, whereas healthy control cells  were not labeled. Similar results were observed in intact  ovarian tissues where cytochrome c display occurred specifically in nurse cells at a stage before any overt sign of  apoptosis. To our knowledge, apoptogenic cytochrome c is  the earliest reported molecular indicator of pre-apoptotic  events in these cells and could reflect the point at which  nurse cells become irreversibly committed to programmed  cell death.</p><p>Although mAb 2G8 was originally produced against rat  cytochrome c, we conclude that the immunoreactive signal  corresponds to a specific configuration of the <italic>Drosophila</italic>  counterpart for the following reasons. First, the immunogen for mAb 2G8 shares &#x0003e;86% identity to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c (DC4) including the immunodominant aspartic acid at position 62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Mueller and Jemmerson, 1996</xref>).  Second, all labeling was abolished by pre-absorption with  antigen. Therefore, mAb 2G8, rather than a contaminant,  is responsible for the in situ signal we have observed.  Third, in biochemical fractionation assays and immunofluorescence studies, the signal was localized to the  mitochondrial compartment where cytochrome c resides.  Fourth, mAb 2G8 immunoprecipitated products of the  correct size (&#x0223c;13 kD), which cross-reacted with a different  cytochrome c antibody specific for a distinct epitope.  These studies establish the ability of mAb 2G8 to recognize cytochrome c in crude fly cell extracts and were validated in similar assays showing that mAb 2G8 could immunoprecipitate purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c (not  shown).</p><p>Selective labeling of pre-apoptotic cells by mAb 2G8 indicates that apoptotic signaling triggers specific alterations  in the configuration of cytochrome c that uncover an otherwise hidden epitope. Moreover, routine labeling of apoptotic SL2 cells with a variety of antibodies directed against  different antigens does not behave like mAb 2G8, and we  can readily exclude the possibility that the pre-apoptotic  condition somehow promotes enhanced immunodetection. Based on numerous precedents, exposure of an otherwise hidden epitope through immunodetection could  pave the way for developing reagents that probe specific  protein conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kapoor et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Cumber et al.,  1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">Yewdell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Cebolla et al., 1996</xref>). In the case  of fly cytochrome c, the precise nature of this change is not  yet clear, but the alteration could reflect either a modified  conformation and/or changes in associated proteins that  permit immunoreactivity with the 2G8 antibody. In contrast to several mammalian models of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Reed,  1997a</xref>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein was not released to the cytosol during apoptosis but instead continued to cofractionate with mitochondria. Therefore, the fly version of this  protein could be more tightly tethered to its resident organelle than its mammalian counterpart. Also, since no covalent differences between healthy and pre-apoptotic samples of cytochrome c have yet been detected (either in our  system or in mammalian models), our studies implicate a  conformational and/or contextual change in cytochrome c  which specifically occurs in cells that are committed to apoptotic death.</p><p>One possibility is that antibody binding to the reactive  epitope could be hindered by mitochondrial components  in live cells. In cells committed to apoptosis, fly cytochrome c might translocate from the intermembrane space,  but remain tethered to the outer membrane, and in the  process, also expose the epitope for mAb 2G8. Except for  the fact that the protein is not physically released, this scenario suggests features in common with mammalian models, where cytochrome c is liberated from mitochondria.  Alternatively the polypeptide may simply undergo a conformational change detected by mAb 2G8 that does not  affect its location. Consistent with this possibility, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Jemmerson et al. (1999)</xref> have obtained evidence that mouse  cytochrome c does assume a different conformation early  in apoptosis of a T cell hybridoma. The altered conform  was detected using yet a different mAb than the one used  here, which does not recognize native cytochrome c but  does recognize nonnative forms of the protein, such as  large peptide fragments. These observations are entirely  consistent with at least some mammalian cell models of  apoptosis where cytochrome c remains in the mitochondria but is inactivated by death signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Krippner et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Adachi et al., 1997</xref>). While the precise nature of the  change remains to be determined, the alteration is evidently specific for apoptotic forms of cell death. For instance, 2G8 immunostaining was not observed when SL2  cultures were killed by exposure to levels of ceramide that  provoke a mode of cell death that is distinctly necrotic (see  Materials and Methods).</p><p>We authenticated a role for cytochrome c in apoptosis by  examining staged ovarian tissues where the programmed  death of identifiable cell types is well described. In a single  egg chamber, one oocyte is connected through cytoplasmic  bridges to 15 sister nurse cells. Over a period of slightly &#x0003e;3 d,  the egg chamber develops through a sequence of well-defined stages before reaching maturity at the final stage  of oogenesis, stage 14. Between stages 10B and 13 of oogenesis, the nurse cells undergo considerable changes  that include a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Gutzeit, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cooley et al., 1992</xref>) and a permeabilization  of nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Okada and Waddington, 1959</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Giorgi and Deri, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Cooley et al., 1992</xref>). These changes  are thought to facilitate the transfer of nurse cell components into the developing oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">King, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Tourmente  et al., 1990</xref>) and once completed, this process is quickly  followed by the programmed death of the nurse cells  themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Sang and King, 1959</xref>). Dying nurse cells display physiological changes common to apoptotic cells,  such as elevated caspase RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>) and  a requirement for caspase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">McCall and Steller,  1998</xref>). Similarly, diverse morphological criteria such as  TUNEL labeling and acridine orange staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Foley and  Cooley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">McCall and Steller, 1998</xref>; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and ultrastructural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Giorgi and Deri, 1976</xref>) all point toward an apoptotic mode of death for late staged nurse  cells.</p><p>In our studies with the 2G8 antibody, only pre-apoptotic  nurse cells were positive for cytochrome c staining. Furthermore, in double-label analyses the immunoreactive  signal was detected long before overt signs of apoptosis  were visualized either with a cytoplasmic marker (cortical  actin visualized with phalloidin) or with a nuclear marker  (TUNEL labeling). To our knowledge, these observations  are the first demonstration that changes in cytochrome c  actually anticipate programmed cell death within intact  tissues and, since these observations occur in an invertebrate model, they also argue for widespread conservation  of cytochrome c&#x02013;associated functions in apoptotic physiology.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, at least three genes, <italic>rpr</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>hid</italic>  function as potent activators of the apoptotic pathway and,  collectively, these genes are required for cell death in the  embryo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>). Generally,  expression of each precedes programmed cell death, and  each is sufficient to elicit apoptosis in cultured cells and in  transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">White et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Grether et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996b</xref>). Work presented here offers a cytological demonstration that signaling by <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>grim</italic> trigger  events which ultimately engage cytochrome c and is consistent with recent observations that <italic>rpr</italic> can provoke cytochrome c release in heterologous extracts from <italic>Xenopus</italic>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Evans et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> death activators engage caspase function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>)  and therefore we examined the effects of the viral caspase  inhibitor, p35, and peptide-based inhibitors, ZVAD-fmk  and DEVD-fmk, upon cytochrome c display. We and others had shown previously that caspase inhibitors prevent  apoptosis induced by <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>grim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Grether et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Nordstrom et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Pronk et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">White et al., 1996</xref>) and, as demonstrated here, coexpression of p35 or incubation with anticaspase peptides  similarly prevented immunodetection of cytochrome c  that would otherwise occur in the presence of <italic>rpr</italic> or <italic>grim</italic>  alone. These results demonstrate that display of apoptogenic cytochrome c requires caspase activity. To further test  this idea, we examined the status of cytochrome c in cells  where apoptosis was directly triggered by expression of an  activated caspase, <italic>dcp-1.</italic> As expected, this protein promoted apoptogenic cytochrome c display, with features  that were indistinguishable from labeling provoked by the  death activators. Taken together, our data establish that  caspase action is both necessary and sufficient to elicit pre-apoptotic alterations in cytochrome c.</p><p>Cell-free models of apoptosis from vertebrate sources  have implicated an important role for mitochondrial factors in the activation of some caspase enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Liu et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">Zamzami et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Evans et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Kluck et al.,  1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kroemer et al., 1997</xref>). The cell-free experiments  presented here are consistent with these reports, and with  our in vivo studies indicating that signaling by <italic>rpr</italic> and <italic>grim</italic>  engage one or more resident mitochondrial proteins. Is the  apoptogenic form of cytochrome c solely responsible for  caspase activation in our cell-free system? We tested this  possibility in two ways, both of which were inconclusive.  First, we found that the 2G8 anti&#x02013;cytochrome c antibody  did not interfere with the ability of apoptotic mitochondria  to provoke caspase activation and second, we found that  purified cytochrome c (from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, horse, and rabbit) was not sufficient on its own to promote caspase activity when added to cytosol from L2 cells. These data suggest that the 2G8 mAb might recognize, but not inhibit,  cytochrome c in association with other proteins as component of a preformed apoptosome mitochondrial complex  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Green, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Green and Reed, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Hengartner, 1998</xref>).  It is also entirely possible that other mitochondrial factors  (perhaps a <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent of AIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Kroemer et al.,  1997</xref>, a mitochondrial caspase, or a novel molecule) might  play important roles during caspase amplification in this  system. Further studies will be required to address this  issue.</p><p>Two potential explanations reconcile our in vivo observations on apoptogenic cytochrome c with reports from  mammalian cell-free systems that cytochrome c can trigger  caspase activation. One possibility is that the order and/or  nature of cytochrome c apoptotic function is not conserved between mammals and insects and thus, relative to  caspase action, cytochrome c is upstream in the former  case and downstream in the latter case. This scenario,  however, seems unlikely given the widespread conservation of apoptotic components, the fact that display of fly  cytochrome c in the animal significantly precedes all signs  of programmed cell death, and reports from mammalian  systems that upstream caspases can trigger cytochrome c  release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Reed, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Luo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Scaffidi et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, a more likely interpretation of  our results is that cytochrome c propagates apoptotic  physiology by functioning together with caspases in a feed-forward amplification loop. In this scenario, altered cytochrome c and caspase activity exert positive and reciprocal  feedback upon each other, similar to observations recently  reported for caspase 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Kuwana et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, agents  that restrain caspase action (p35) are also predicted to  suppress pro-apoptotic display of cytochrome c, which behaves as an amplifier of caspase function. This interpretation is also consistent with recent studies on Fas signaling  in type II cells, where molecular ordering studies found  that activation of an initiator caspase (caspase 8/Flice) occurs upstream of changes associated with cytochrome c  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Scaffidi et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Immunoprecipita-tion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cytochrome c.
