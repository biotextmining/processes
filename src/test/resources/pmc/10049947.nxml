Nramp1</italic> is expressed primarily in macrophages and  mutations at this locus cause susceptibility to infectious diseases. <italic>Nramp2</italic> has a much broader  range of tissue expression and mutations at <italic>Nramp2</italic> result in iron deficiency, indicating a role  for Nramp2 in iron metabolism. To get further insight into the function and mechanism of action of Nramp proteins, we have generated isoform specific anti-Nramp1 and anti-Nramp2 antisera. Immunoblotting experiments indicate that Nramp2 is present in a number of cell types,  including hemopoietic precursors, and is coexpressed with Nramp1 in primary macrophages  and macrophage cell lines. Nramp2 is expressed as a 90&#x02013;100-kD integral membrane protein extensively modified by glycosylation (&#x0003e;40% of molecular mass). Subcellular localization studies  by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy indicate distinct and nonoverlapping localization for Nramp1 and Nramp2. Nramp1 is expressed in the lysosomal compartment, whereas  Nramp2 is not detectable in the lysosomes but is expressed primarily in recycling endosomes  and also, to a lower extent, at the plasma membrane, colocalizing with transferrin. These findings suggest that Nramp2 plays a key role in the metabolism of transferrin-bound iron by transporting free Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> across the endosomal membrane and into the cytoplasm.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>transport</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Naturally occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) or experimentally induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>)  mutations at the <italic>Nramp1</italic> (natural resistance associated  macrophage protein 1)<sup>1</sup> locus in vivo impair macrophage  function and cause susceptibility to infection by intracellular pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> in mice. In humans, polymorphic variants at <italic>Nramp1</italic>  are associated with increased susceptibility to tuberculosis  and leprosy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Studies in vitro in explanted cell populations have indicated that mutations at <italic>Nramp1</italic> affect the  ability of the macrophage to restrict the intracellular replication of antigenically unrelated microorganisms. We  cloned the <italic>Nramp1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and showed that its mRNA is  expressed abundantly in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) and is inducible in macrophages by exposure to  cytokines and bacterial endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Predicted amino acid  sequence analysis indicates that Nramp1 has many characteristics of an integral membrane transport protein including 12 putative transmembrane (TM) domains, several  predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, and a sequence signature previously identified in a number of eukaryotic and  prokaryotic transport proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In macrophages, direct  biochemical studies have shown that Nramp1 is a membrane phosphoglycoprotein of apparent mass 90&#x02013;110 kD  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which is expressed in the Lamp1-positive lysosomal  compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Moreover, studies in phagosomes containing either latex beads or intact bacteria have shown that  upon phagocytosis, Nramp1 is recruited to the membrane  of the phagosome, where it remains during its maturation  to phagolysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These findings suggest that Nramp1  may affect resistance to infection by modulating the intravesicular milieu of the bacterial phagosome.</p><p>We have identified a second <italic>Nramp</italic> gene in mammals,  <italic>Nramp2</italic>, which encodes a protein highly similar to Nramp1  (78% identity over the hydrophobic core) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). As opposed  to the phagocyte-specific expression of <italic>Nramp1</italic>, <italic>Nramp2</italic>  mRNA expression has been detected in most tissues and  cell types analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Recently, it was shown that  the <italic>Nramp2</italic> gene is mutated (G185R) in two animal models of iron deficiency, the <italic>mk</italic> mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the <italic>Belgrade</italic>  rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The <italic>mk</italic> mouse displays deficiency in intestinal iron  uptake and microcytic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The <italic>Belgrade</italic> rat  also shows a defect in intestinal iron absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Moreover, studies in oocytes have shown that Nramp2 can  transport a number of divalent cations such as Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>,  and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in a pH-dependent, electrogenic fashion associated with the symport of a single proton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In addition,  transient overexpression of the wild type but not G185R  <italic>Nramp2</italic> in HEK293T cells results in a robust stimulation of  cellular <sup>55</sup>Fe uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Nramp2 is the transferrin-independent system responsible for dietary iron absorption in the intestine. However, the ubiquitous expression of <italic>Nramp2</italic> mRNA suggests  that it may be involved in iron metabolism in other tissues  as well. As opposed to Nramp1, where the cellular and  subcellular localization of the protein have been established, the lack of isoform-specific, anti-Nramp2 antibodies  has precluded the identification of the cell type and of the  subcellular compartment expressing this protein. Such information is critical to elucidate the role of the Nramp2  protein in cellular iron metabolism. In particular, the demonstrated H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-driven, Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transport activity of Nramp2, as  well as its expression in a wide variety of tissues, make it a  likely candidate not only for transferrin-independent iron  absorption in the intestine but also for the transferrin- dependent uptake of iron in peripheral tissues. It is well established that acidification of the endosomal compartment  causes Fe<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> release from transferrin and that reductases then  convert the Fe<sup>3&#x0002b;</sup> to Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but the mechanism of transport  of Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> across the endosomal membrane has not yet been  elucidated.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Immunogens.</title><p>For the production of isoform-specific polyclonal antisera directed against Nramp2, rabbits were immunized  with fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase (GST)  fused to a peptide segment derived from the amino terminal region of Nramp2 (residues 1&#x02013;71; for amino acid numbering see  reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

These protein species migrated as broad bands in  SDS&#x02013;acrylamide gels. In membrane preparations from  Nramp2-transfected CHO cells (CHON2), the affinity-purified anti-Nramp2 antiserum recognized a single protein  species of apparent molecular mass 90&#x02013;100 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A,  top). Immunoblotting analysis of the same set of membrane  fractions with anti-Nramp1 antiserum revealed a single protein species of 85&#x02013;95 kD in membranes from the Nramp1-transfected CHO cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A, middle). These immunoreactive bands were absent from untransfected CHO  cells and from transfected cells expressing the other Nramp  isoform. The electrophoretic mobility characteristics of the  Nramp1 and Nramp2 detected by the respective polyclonal  antisera were very similar to those of the species detected  by the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody in the same cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A,  bottom). The reactivity and isoform specificity of the antibodies were confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies of  [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine metabolically labeled cell extracts from  CHO cells or from Nramp1 and Nramp2 CHO transfectants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). These data indicate that the anti-Nramp1  and anti-Nramp2 antisera produced and purified according  to our protocol are isoform specific. </p><p>Northern blotting and in situ hybridization studies have  shown that, as opposed to <italic>Nramp1</italic>, which is expressed almost exclusively in mononuclear phagocytes, <italic>Nramp2</italic>  mRNA is expressed in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We questioned whether the two Nramp proteins would display an  overlapping or mutually exclusive expression pattern. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from a panel of murine hematological cell lines revealed a readily detectable  level of <italic>Nramp2</italic> mRNA expression in the macrophage  lines RAW 264.7 and J774a as well as in Friend virus&#x02013; transformed erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A, top;  exposure time 1 wk). A much lower level of expression of  <italic>Nramp2</italic> was found in other cell lines: WEHI 231 (B lymphocyte), WEHI 3B (myelomonocyte), 70/Z (pre-B lymphocyte), and BI 141 (T lymphocyte). In comparison,  <italic>Nramp1</italic> mRNA expression was restricted to the macrophage cell lines RAW264.7 and J774a and is expressed  at levels &#x0223c;50-fold higher than that of <italic>Nramp2</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A,  middle; exposure time 24 h). Thus, <italic>Nramp1</italic> and <italic>Nramp2</italic>  mRNAs are coexpressed in macrophages. </p><p>To analyze Nramp2 protein expression in macrophages,  membrane fractions were prepared from thioglycolate- induced primary mouse macrophages, from J774a and RAW  264.7 cultured macrophages. For comparison, membranes  were also prepared from cell lines derived from tissues previously shown to express a high level of <italic>Nramp2</italic> mRNA:  the Sertoli cell line TM4 and the kidney inner medullary  collecting duct line mIMCD-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Membranes were also  prepared from control and Nramp2-transfected CHO cells,  as well as from two cell lines expressing low levels of  <italic>Nramp2</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A, WEHI 231 and WEHI 3B).  The membranes were analyzed by immunoblotting with  the anti-Nramp2 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, B and C). The antibody  detected a major heterogeneous immunoreactive protein  species of broad electrophoretic mobility with an apparent  molecular mass of 80&#x02013;90 kD in all cells tested, with the exception of WEHI 231 cells and untransfected CHO cells.  The protein was most abundant in TM4, RAW 264.7,  J774a and MEL cells. The protein was also detected in the  membranes prepared from primary mouse macrophages  and mIMCD-3 cells, although at a lower level. WEHI 3B  membranes showed the lowest level of Nramp2 expression,  whereas WEHI 231 and untransfected CHO cells were  negative for Nramp2 expression. In the positive membrane  samples, the electrophoretic mobility and heterogeneity of  the immunoreactive species varied, possibly due to different posttranslational modification of the protein in these  cell types. Thus, <italic>Nramp2</italic> is expressed in a wide variety of  tissues, including macrophages, and macrophages coexpress  Nramp1 and Nramp2.</p><p>The apparent mass of endogenous Nramp2 estimated by  SDS-PAGE is considerably greater than the 62.3 kD molecular mass predicted by the primary amino acid sequence of  the cDNA. Together with the broadness of the immunoreactive band, this anomalous mobility suggests that Nramp2  may be posttranslationally modified by glycosylation. To  test this hypothesis, membrane fractions from J774a cells  and Nramp2-transfected CHO cells were treated with endoglycosidases followed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Nramp2 was resistant to digestion with Endo H  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C, lanes 1 and 2), which specifically cleaves high  mannose and some hybrid N-linked oligosaccharides from  glycoproteins. In contrast, PNGaseF, which hydrolyzes high  mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides, converted  the 82-kD Nramp2 species into smaller forms of approximate apparent molecular masses of 50&#x02013;55 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C, lane  4). PNGase treatment of membranes from the Nramp2  CHO transfectants also resulted in a shift of the apparent  molecular mass of the protein from 85 to &#x0223c;56 kD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C,  lanes 6 and 7). Therefore, Nramp2 is posttranslationally  modified extensively by complex N-linked glycosylation.</p><p>To gain insight into the subcellular localization of  Nramp2, we first performed immunofluorescence studies  on CHO and RAW 264.7 transfected cells, using an antibody directed against the <italic>c-myc</italic> epitope attached to the carboxy terminus of the transfected Nramp2 protein. The  high levels of transfected protein in these cell lines facilitated nonambiguous localization of Nramp2, without possible limitation associated with low levels of expression of  the endogenous protein. We have previously observed that  the <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;tagged Nramp2 protein is functional in both  CHO and RAW macrophage backgrounds and carries out  active Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transport in these cells (Govoni, G., and P.  Gros, unpublished results). We initially tested whether  Nramp2 localizes to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, as found earlier for Nramp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To label the lysosomal compartment, cells were cultured in the presence  of FITC&#x02013;conjugated dextran, followed by a chase period of  30 min to remove the dextran from the early endosomal  compartments, before fixation and immunostaining with  the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody. In Nramp1-transfected CHO  cells, there was clear colocalization of the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A) and the dextran-loaded late endosomal/lysosomal compartment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). Nramp1-stained vesicles  negative for FITC&#x02013;dextran were also detected. In contrast,  in Nramp2-transfected CHO cells, anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> staining revealed an intracellular network of finer punctate vesicles  distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C). This staining does not appear to colocalize with the FITC&#x02013;dextran  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D). Similar results were obtained in parallel experiments using the <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;Nramp1 and <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;Nramp2-transfected RAW cells (data not shown), indicating that  Nramp2 is not expressed in the lysosomal compartment.  Thus, Nramp1 and Nramp2 clearly appear to have distinct,  nonoverlapping subcellular sites of expression. </p><p>Since Nramp2 is implicated in cellular iron uptake, it appears logical that Nramp2 be present at the plasma membrane and/or in recycling endosomes. To label these compartments, CHO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and RAW transfected cells (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) were cultured in the presence of FITC&#x02013;conjugated  transferrin before fixation and immunostaining with the  anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody. Analysis by confocal microscopy indicated that, as expected, transferrin (green) stained both the  plasma membrane (ring-like staining at the edge of the  cells) and the recycling endosomes (subcellular punctate  staining) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). A very similar and overlapping pattern  was observed for Nramp2, as revealed by the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody (red, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). Superimposition of the two images  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C) clearly identifies colocalization (yellow) of the  two signals. Certain cells stained with FITC&#x02013;transferrin but  were negative for the <italic>c-myc</italic> staining, suggesting that although these cells are positive for the pSV2neo plasmid and  are resistant to G418, they failed to express <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;tagged  Nramp2. Such cells provide an internal control for the  specificity of the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> staining and for the overlapping  staining with FITC&#x02013;transferrin. Similarly, when untransfected CHO cells were identically processed and examined,  the cells were not stained with the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D), but displayed a normal pattern of staining with  FITC&#x02013;transferrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> E). Finally, when the lysosomes of  the Nramp2-transfected cells were stained with FITC&#x02013;dextran (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> H) and with the anti&#x02013;<italic>c-myc</italic> antibody for  Nramp2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> G), no significant overlap between the two  signals was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> I). A similar colocalization of  Nramp2 and FITC&#x02013;transferrin was noted in parallel experiments with RAW macrophages expressing <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013; Nramp2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results confirm that Nramp1 and  Nramp2 have nonoverlapping, subcellular localization, and  that Nramp2 colocalizes with transferrin in the early recycling endosomal compartment.  </p><p>To confirm the endosomal localization of Nramp2 determined in transfected CHO and RAW cells, we performed immunofluorescence in nontransfected cell lines  that tested positive (MEL, TM4) or negative (WEHI 231)  for Nramp2 expression by immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Immunofluorescence was performed with the anti-Nramp2  polyclonal antiserum and FITC&#x02013;transferrin, and results are  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. In MEL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, A and B) and TM4 (C  and D) cells, the endogenous Nramp2 protein (B and D)  showed very similar staining pattern to that generated by  FITC&#x02013;transferrin (A and C), similar to that seen in transfected cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Finally, in agreement with the  absence of Nramp2 expression in WEHI 231 cells noted by  immunoblotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B), no Nramp2 staining was observed in WEHI231 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> F), although the endosomal compartment of these cells could readily be labeled by  FITC&#x02013;transferrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> E). Together, these results verify  data obtained in transfected CHO and RAW cells. </p><p>The localization of Nramp2 to the plasma membrane  and endosomal network raised the possibility that like  Nramp1, Nramp2 may become associated with phagosomal membranes after phagocytosis. Phagosomes are initially  derived from the plasma membrane and are known to sequentially interact and acquire proteins from both early and  late endosomes before their final fusion with lysosomes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). We have shown that Nramp1 is acquired during the  phagosomal maturation process, using the model system of  latex bead&#x02013;containing phagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Latex bead&#x02013;containing phagosomes are ideal for microscopic examination  and can also be purified from cell homogenates by flotation  on sucrose gradients. To determine whether Nramp2 can  associate with the phagosomal membrane, J774a cells were  fed latex beads for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, and the phagosomal fraction  was isolated from cell homogenates by fractionation on sucrose gradient. Equal amounts of the purified phagosomal  fraction and of a crude total membrane fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the relative amount of endogenous Nramp2 in each sample was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A (left), Nramp2 was  significantly enriched in purified phagosomes as compared  to the crude membrane preparation. In these experiments,  the Lamp1 protein (marker of the phagolysosome, center)  and the transferrin receptor (marker of the plasma membrane, right) were used as controls. As expected, significant  enrichment of Lamp1 was seen in the phagosomal fraction  whereas the transferrin receptor was not enriched in phagosomes even though it is readily detectable in crude membrane fractions. These results suggest that Nramp2 becomes  associated with the phagosome during its maturation to  phagolysosome. Possible association of Nramp2 with latex  beads phagosomes was further analyzed in J774a cells by  immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. J774a cells  were fed latex beads and then fixed and processed by  double immunofluorescence using anti-Nramp2 and anti-Lamp1 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B). In J774a cells, the Nramp2  signal obtained with our antibody was weak, which limited  the analysis. Nevertheless, in several of the sections analyzed a portion of the Nramp2 signal could clearly be seen  at the periphery of the bead, suggesting association with the  phagosome. However, this signal was much weaker than  that obtained using the anti-Lamp1 antibody. Thus, results  from immunoblotting and immunofluorescence suggest the  possibility that a portion of the endosomal Nramp2 protein  becomes associated with the phagosome during phagolysosome maturation. </p></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A large body of biochemical data supports the proposal  that Nramp2 functions as a transporter for several divalent  cations, including Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). <italic>Nramp2</italic> is mutated  in the <italic>mk</italic> mouse and in the <italic>Belgrade</italic> rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), with both  animals exhibiting a severe microcytic hypochromic anemia and a severe defect in iron absorption by intestinal cells  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, in vitro studies have shown that iron  acquisition is also decreased in the peripheral cells and tissues of these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and that the anemia cannot be corrected by direct iron injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), suggesting a  second block of iron entry into peripheral tissues. Thus,  physiological consequences of <italic>Nramp2</italic> mutations in vivo  strongly suggest that Nramp2 is not only involved in iron  uptake at the level of the intestinal enterocyte but also participates in iron acquisition in other cell types as well. In  peripheral tissues, cellular iron uptake is through the transferrin cycle (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Diferric transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor and is internalized, and  acidification of the internalized vesicles results in release of  iron from transferrin followed by alkalinization of the vesicles and recycling of the receptor to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).  Iron escapes the acidified endosomal compartment to reach  the cytoplasm, where it can be captured by mitochondria  for heme biosynthesis and incorporation into heme-containing proteins, stored in the cytoplasm in the form of  ferritin, and/or used directly for synthesis of nonheme-containing proteins (e.g., ribonucleotide reductase). The  mechanism by which iron is extruded from the acidified  endosome to enter the cytoplasm is unknown and has been  a matter of considerable debate.</p><p>In the current study, we have raised isoform specific  anti-Nramp2 antiserum and have used it to verify a number  of structural and biochemical features of Nramp2 predicted  from the primary amino acid sequence deduced from the  cDNA. These analyses have shown that Nramp2 is an integral membrane protein which is extensively modified by  N-linked glycosylation. As opposed to Nramp1, which is  macrophage-specific, Nramp2 protein was found ubiquitously expressed in a majority of cell lines analyzed. The  current study has also clearly established that Nramp2  and Nramp1 localize to distinct subcellular compartments.  Whereas Nramp1 colocalizes with FITC&#x02013;dextran in the lysosomal compartment, Nramp2 is not detectable in this  compartment but rather shows clear colocalization with  FITC&#x02013;transferrin both at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes. The demonstration of Nramp2 expression in several peripheral tissues, the colocalization of  Nramp2 and transferrin in plasma membrane and recycling  endosomes, the iron transport properties of the Nramp2  protein, and the effect of Nramp2 mutations on iron metabolism in peripheral tissues are strong evidence that  Nramp2 is responsible for transporting Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> into the cytoplasm after acidification of the transferrin-positive endosome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Interestingly, this acidification would simultaneously provide a gating mechanism for iron transport by  Nramp2 and for release from transferrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Indeed,  the pH dependence of iron transport by Nramp2 has been  demonstrated in several systems, including <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), transfected HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and CHO cells (Govoni, G., and P. Gros, unpublished results). Likewise, release of iron from transferrin and its subsequent release  from endosomes is dependent on endosome acidification,  which can be inhibited by bafilomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) and concanamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), specific inhibitors of the vacuolar H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATPase,  but is insensitive to the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATPase inhibitor ouabain  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). This suggests a critical role for the vacuolar H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013; ATPase in this process. Indeed, the association of vacuolar  H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATPase with transferrin-positive endosomal vesicles  has been demonstrated by immunohistochemical means in  LLC&#x02013;porcine kidney epithelial 1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). </p><p>The demonstration that Nramp1 and Nramp2 are coexpressed in the same cell type with distinct subcellular localizations suggests possible functional parallels between  Nramp1 and Nramp2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Both the yeast Smf1 and the  mammalian Nramp2 proteins can transport Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, with the  latter also transporting Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and other divalent cations.  Nramp2 and Smf1 share approximately 40% sequence  identity within the conserved hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). As  the mammalian Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins share almost  80% sequence identity within their hydrophobic cores, it is  likely that Nramp1 is involved in the transport of divalent  cations as well. The removal of such metabolically essential  ions from the phagosomal space would provide an attractive explanation for the observed pleiotropic effect of  <italic>Nramp1</italic> mutations in vivo on the replicative potential of  internalized microbes that inhabit the phagosomal space in  macrophages. Additionally, the observation that a portion  of Nramp2 associates with latex bead phagosomes in J774a  cells suggests that Nramp2 may also play a role in depleting  the phagosomal space of divalent cations necessary for microbial survival.</p><p>Despite considerable efforts, transport studies in CHO  and RAW cells transfected and overexpressing Nramp1  protein have so far failed to demonstrate an Nramp1-mediated transport of either <sup>54</sup>Mn or <sup>55</sup>Fe transport in these cells  (Govoni, G., and P. Gros, unpublished results). The distinct, nonoverlapping distribution of Nramp1 and Nramp2  reported here provides an explanation for this apparent lack  of transport activity associated with Nramp1. While the  two proteins may have the same transport potential, the  observed targeting of Nramp2 to the plasma membrane and  recycling endosome compartment would result in a net increase in cellular accumulation of extracellularly added, radiolabeled ligand under acidic pH transport assay conditions. On the other hand, the restricted expression of  Nramp1 to the lysosomal compartment would not cause a  similar increased cellular uptake of a ligand presented in the  extracellular milieu, although it could act on such ligand if  present in the phagolysosomal space. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that both Nramp1 and Nramp2 have similar transport function but act at different, nonoverlapping,  intracellular sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). If Nramp1 and Nramp2 do indeed transport the same substrates, it is also tempting to  speculate that vesicular acidification via the vacuolar H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013; ATPase may provide a key common gating mechanism for  the activation of both transporters, through fusion with  vacuolar H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;ATPase-positive vesicles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Possible  similarities and differences in the mechanism of action and  regulation of Nramp1 and Nramp2 in macrophages are  currently being investigated.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>After affinity purification, anti-Nramp1 and anti-Nramp2 antisera were tested for  specificity and reactivity by immunoblotting against crude  membrane fractions (A) as well  as by immunoprecipitation of  [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine&#x02013;labeled cell lysates (B) from CHO cells or  from the same cells transfected  with a <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;tagged (tag sequence EQKLISEEDL) Nramp1  (CHON1) or a <italic>c-myc</italic>&#x02013;tagged  Nramp2 (CHON2).

Nramp2 is  present at the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes but is not functional at neutral pH. When  diferric transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor,  the complex is internalized. After recruitment of the  V&#x02013;ATPase, the endosome acidifies, causing dissociation of iron from transferrin as well as activation of  Nramp2 function. Iron can then be cotransported  along with a proton across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol. In the case of Nramp1, bacteria that contain and require iron are taken up in phagosomes at the plasma membrane. These phagosomes acquire both Nramp1 and the V&#x02013;ATPase.  Acidification of the phagosome provides the driving force for the cotransport of iron and protons out of the phagosome in order to sequester iron away  from the bacteria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM981720.f8a"/><graphic xlink:href="JEM981720.f8b"/></fig></sec><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Elia Abi-Jaoude and Dr. Danny Baranes (McGill University) for expert  technical help and advice, Dr. W.
