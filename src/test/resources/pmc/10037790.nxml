Little is known about mechanisms of complex assembly  or intracellular trafficking, or how these processes  might ultimately regulate adhesion functions of the  complex at the cell surface. The cytoplasmic domain of  E-cadherin contains two putative basal-lateral sorting  motifs, which are homologous to sorting signals in the  low density lipoprotein receptor, but an alanine scan  across tyrosine residues in these motifs did not affect  the fidelity of newly synthesized E-cadherin delivery to  the basal-lateral membrane of MDCK cells. Nevertheless, sorting signals are located in the cytoplasmic domain since a chimeric protein (GP2CAD1), comprising  the extracellular domain of GP2 (an apical membrane  protein) and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of E-cadherin, was efficiently and specifically delivered to the basal-lateral membrane. Systematic deletion and recombination of specific regions of the  cytoplasmic domain of GP2CAD1 resulted in delivery  of &#x0003c;10% of these newly synthesized proteins to both  apical and basal-lateral membrane domains. Significantly, &#x0003e;90% of each mutant protein was retained in  the ER. None of these mutants formed a strong interaction with &#x003b2;-catenin, which normally occurs shortly after  E-cadherin synthesis. In addition, a simple deletion mutation of E-cadherin that lacks &#x003b2;-catenin binding is also  localized intracellularly. Thus, &#x003b2;-catenin binding to the  whole cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin correlates  with efficient and targeted delivery of E-cadherin to the  lateral plasma membrane. In this capacity, we suggest  that &#x003b2;-catenin acts as a chauffeur, to facilitate transport  of E-cadherin out of the ER and the plasma membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>epithelia</kwd><kwd>adhesion</kwd><kwd>protein  targeting</kwd><kwd>membrane domains</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>E<sc>pithelial</sc> cells form barriers that separate the internal milieu from the outer environment of multicellular organisms, and vectorially transport ions and  solutes between these compartments. To perform these  functions, these cells form cell&#x02013;cell contacts through cadherin adhesion proteins, establish tight seals between cell&#x02013; cell contacts (tight junctions), and organize the plasma  membrane into structurally and functionally distinct  domains, termed apical and basal-lateral, that face these  different compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson,  1989</xref>).</p><p>Localization of transmembrane proteins to specific  plasma membrane domains is achieved by protein sorting  in the Golgi and subsequent delivery to specific membrane  domains, and by selective retention of proteins in the  plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Nelson, 1992</xref>). Molecular mechanisms  involved in protein sorting and delivery are poorly understood. To date, the only identified sorting signal for apical  membrane proteins in MDCK cells is a glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI)<sup>1</sup> linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brown et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lisanti et al.,  1989</xref>; for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Nosjean et al., 1997</xref>). How  the lipid anchor specifies apical domain-specific sorting  and targeting in the TGN is not clear. It has been proposed  that the GPI anchor enables the protein to enter glycosphingolipid clusters and, thereby, to be sorted to the  apical membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Simons and Wandinger, 1990</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Weimbs et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Several amino acid motifs have been identified that  specify type-I transmembrane protein sorting in the TGN  and delivery to the basal-lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Rodriguez-Boulan and Powell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matter and Mellman, 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Weimbs et al., 1997</xref>). These motifs are located in the cytoplasmic domain and include tyrosine-based sorting signals  of VSV-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Thomas et al., 1993</xref>) and LDL receptor (LDL-R;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matter et al., 1992</xref>), non-tyrosine-based signals of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Casanova et al.,  1991</xref>), and the di-leucine motif of Fc receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hunziker  and Fumey, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Matter et al., 1994</xref>). It is noteworthy that  these proteins are not known to associate with heterologous membrane protein binding partners or accessory proteins in the secretory pathway.</p><p>E-cadherin, a type-I single-span transmembrane protein, is an endogenous adhesion molecule of epithelial  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kemler, 1992</xref>). E-cadherin mediates cell&#x02013;cell adhesion by calcium-dependent homotypic interactions between  E-cadherin extracellular domains on opposing membranes  of contacting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Nagafuchi et al., 1987</xref>). However,  strong adhesion requires linkage of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Nagafuchi  and Takeichi, 1988</xref>). This linkage is mediated by direct  binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aberle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Jou et al., 1995</xref>); the minimal  &#x003b2;-catenin binding site on E-cadherin is thought to be a 30&#x02013; amino acid basic sequence in the middle of the cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler, 1994</xref>). In turn,  &#x003b2;-catenin binds &#x003b1;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aberle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Jou et al.,  1995</xref>), which links the cadherin/catenin complex directly  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>) or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Knudsen et al., 1995</xref>) to  the actin cytoskeleton. The stoichiometry of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin complex is 1:1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ozawa and  Kemler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hinck et al., 1994a</xref>). Finally, evidence has  accumulated that E-cadherin forms dimers through interactions between the extracellular and/or membrane proximal domains of adjacent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shapiro et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brieher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Yap et al., 1998</xref>). In  polarized MDCK cells, E-cadherin is localized to the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Le Bivic et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shore and Nelson,  1991</xref>), and newly synthesized E-cadherin is preferentially  sorted in the Golgi and delivered directly to the basal-lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Le Bivic et al., 1990</xref>). Mechanisms regulating assembly of the cadherin/catenin complex and targeting of E-cadherin to its site of function at the lateral  membrane domain are unknown.</p><p>We are interested in the relationship between intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins and cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. Previous studies reported that &#x003b2;-catenin binds to the  cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin shortly after E-cadherin synthesis, while &#x003b1;-catenin joins the complex later,  probably after E-cadherin has reached the cell surface  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Ozawa et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hinck et al., 1994a</xref>). Thus, unlike other  type-I membrane proteins studied (see above), E-cadherin  is sorted and targeted to the basal-lateral membrane in a  stoichiometric complex with a cytosolic protein, &#x003b2;-catenin.  This prompted us to explore the relationship between  E-cadherin sorting to the basal-lateral membrane domain  and assembly of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex. There  are two regions of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin  which are similar in amino acid sequence to previously  identified basal-lateral sorting signals of LDL-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matter  et al., 1992</xref>), i.e., a sequence motif of Y---XXX, where X is  an acidic amino acid residue. The first putative sorting signal in E-cadherin is immediately proximal to the transmembrane domain and the other is at the extreme COOH  terminus, also similar to the locations of the two sorting  signals in LDL-R cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We  show that despite these similarities, mutations of tyrosine  to alanine in those two potential basal-lateral sorting signals in E-cadherin do not affect sorting of newly synthesized  mutant E-cadherin in MDCK cells. Further dissection of  the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin using a chimeric  protein approach revealed that E-cadherin exit from the  ER and efficient sorting to the basal-lateral membrane are  coupled to assembly of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex  shortly after E-cadherin synthesis. </p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Monoclonal antibody against rat GP2 has been described previously  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Mays et al., 1995</xref>) and was a gift from Dr. Anson Lowe (Stanford University).

Individual constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing (PAN facility, Stanford University).</p><sec><title>Plasmid for Expression of E-cad<sup>sol</sup>.</title><p>U-GFP, a previously unpublished  plasmid based on CDM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Aruffo and Seed, 1987a</xref>,b), containing a fusion  protein with the extracellular domain of canine E-cadherin jointed with  green fluorescent protein (GFP), was the starting material. The chimeric  coding region is flanked by Hind3 and Not1 sites at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; end, respectively, with a Xho1 site as a linker (reading frame CTC-GAG, Leu-Glu) between the E-cadherin extracellular domain and GFP. The majority  of the cadherin region (Hind3-Xho1, 2.1 kb) is derived from a cDNA  clone (Hind3-Bgl2, 1.9 kb). The small remaining portion of the cadherin  extracellular domain (Bgl2-Xho1, 0.2 kb) was from a PCR product. The  GFP region was replaced with a pair of complimentary oligonucleotides  encoding for the epitope tag of KT3 (amino acid sequence KPPTPPPEPET) and a stop codon, while retaining the Xho1 linker and the 3&#x02032;-end Not1 site. The resulting plasmid is named U-SVLT1. The encoded  soluble, KT3-tagged extracellular domain of canine E-cadherin is named  E-cad<sup>sol</sup>. A PCR reaction was carried out to amplify the coding region of  E-cadherin from the internal endogenous Bgl2 site to the end of the coding region (the stop codon was replaced with a Xho1 site), using canine  E-cadherin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Lee Rubin, University College London, UK) as the template. Note that the PCR product contains a small  part of the extracellular domain and the complete transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of E-cadherin and, after restricting with Bgl2 and  Xho1, was used to replace the Bgl2 and Xho1 portion of U-SVLT1, resulting in the plasmid U-SVLT2. Thus, U-SVLT2 encodes a complete canine  E-cadherin fused with KT3 epitope tag through a Xho1 (Leu-Glu) linker.  Further mutagenesis of the putative basal-lateral sorting signals was carried out by PCR reactions to amplify the region of the Bgl2/Xho1 of  U-SVLT2, as detailed below.</p></sec><sec><title>Plasmids for Expression of E-cad BL1, BL2, and BL12.</title><p>&#x02002;Plasmid U-SVLT3,  which encodes the mutant protein E-cadherin BL2 (Y&#x02192; A mutations in  BL2), was generated by PCR using the pair of oligonucleotides Cad BL-P6  (5&#x02032;-CGC GGG CC<underline>A GAT CT</underline>T CCC CCC AAC ACA TCT-3&#x02032;; Bgl2 site  is underlined) and Cad BL-P3 (5&#x02032;-CGC GGG CTC GAG GTC GTC CTC  GCC ACC <underline>GCC GGC </underline>CAT GTC CGC CAG CTT-3&#x02032;; Nae1 site is underlined). Note that the mutations introduced were accompanied by the introduction of a Nae1 site. The PCR product was used to replace the Bgl2  and Xho1 portion of U-SVLT2. Plasmid U-SVLT5, which encodes the  mutant protein E-cadherin BL1 (Y&#x02192; A mutations in BL1), was generated  by PCR from three reactions. A complimentary pair of oligonucleotides,  Cad BL-P4 (5&#x02032;-GAC ACC CGG GAC AAT GTT <italic>GCA G<underline>CT GC</underline></italic><underline>A G</underline>AT  GAA GAA GGA GGT GG-3&#x02032;) and Cad BL-P5 (5&#x02032;-CCA CCT CCT TCT  TCA T<italic><underline>CT GCA G</underline>CT GC</italic>A ACA TTG TCC CGG GTG TC-3&#x02032;), encode  the (Y&#x02192; A) mutations (italics in the sequences given above) and were synthesized. Note that the introduction of a Pst1 site (underlined, CTGCAG)  accompanied the introduction of the mutations. Two PCR reactions were  carried out with pairs of oligonucleotides Cad BL-P6 (sense) and Cad BL-P5 (anti-sense), Cad BL-P4 (sense) and Cad BL-P2 (antisense, 5&#x02032;-GCG  CCC <underline>CTC GAG</underline> GTC GTC CTC GCC ACC TCC-3&#x02032;; Xho1 site is underlined). The reaction products were mixed and served as the template for  the third reaction with a pair of oligonucleotides, Cad BL-P6 (sense), and  Cad BL-P2 (antisense). The PCR product was subcloned and replaced the  Bgl2-Xho1 portion of the U-SVLT2 to give rise to U-SVLT5.</p><p>The plasmid U-SVLT4 which encodes E-cadherin BL12 (Y&#x02192; A mutation in BL1 and BL2) was constructed in an identical manner as that used  to construct U-SVLT5, except oligonucleotide Cad BL-PL3 was used in  place of Cad BL-P2. Note that in the series of plasmids U-SVLT3, 4, and  5, the identity of the introduced mutations were checked by the presence  of the Pst1 and/or Nae1 restriction sites.</p></sec><sec><title>GP2S.</title><p>Amino acids (aa) 1&#x02013;504 of the coding region of rat GP2 cDNA  (a gift from Dr. Anson Lowe, Stanford University) was amplified by PCR  with a stop codon introduced downstream to amino acid 504, and with  Hind3 and Not1 sites added to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends, respectively. The PCR  product was subcloned into CDM8 through Hind3 and Not1 sites and resulted in the plasmid, GP2S.</p></sec><sec><title>GP2CAD1.</title><p>GP2CAD1 is a chimeric protein of rat GP2 in which the  GPI modification signal has been deleted (named GP2&#x00394;GPI), and the  transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic domain of canine E-cadherin  added.

Primers GP2-1S and  GP2CAD1-3A were used to amplify GP2 using a cDNA clone of rat GP2.  Primer GP2CAD1-2A was used with primer GP2CAD1-1S to amplify the  transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of canine E-cadherin using a  cDNA clone of canine E-cadherin as the template. The PCR products  from the two reactions were mixed and used as template for amplification  using oligonucleotides GP2-1S and GP2CAD1-2A as primers. The final  PCR product was then subcloned into the Hind3-Not1 sites of CDM8, and  the plasmid was named GP2CAD1. GP2CAD1 was then used as the template to create chimeric proteins in the following section.</p></sec><sec><title>GP2CAD1 Truncation Mutants.</title><p>GP2CAD2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are simple  truncation mutants of GP2CAD1. GP2CAD1 was used as the PCR template. Individual antisense oligonucleotides hybridizing with the 6 aa upstream to the desired truncation, with a stop codon and Not1 site, were  used with the oligonucleotide primer GP2-3S (5&#x02032;-CGC GGG CAA <underline>GTC  GAC</underline> TTC GCA GTA GTG AAC C-3&#x02032;), which hybridizes to the region  of the endogenous Sal1 site (underlined in the sequence) close to the  COOH terminus of GP2 coding region, for individual PCR reactions to  amplify parts of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. The resulting PCR  products were cloned into GP2CAD1 through Sal1-Not1 sites.

The PCR product  was subcloned into CDM8FluTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chen et al., 1993</xref>) through Xho1 and  Not1 sites and resulted in an in-frame fusion with the influenza virus  hemagglutinin tag. The resulting plasmid was named HA-BB1. A PCR reaction were carried out to amplify the GP2 and the transmembrane domain of E-cadherin from GP2CAD1 to replace the HA portion in HA-BB1. The resulting plasmid encodes the chimeric protein GP2CAD5,  which comprises GP2 and the transmembrane domain of E-cadherin  fused with 83&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain through a Xho1 linker (Leu-Glu). GP2CAD9 was constructed similarly.</p></sec><sec><title>CD7BB1.</title><p>A human CD7 cDNA clone, CD7-31 (a gift from Dr. Brian  Seed, Harvard University Medical School), was in a CDM8-based expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Aruffo and Seed, 1987b</xref>) and was used directly for transfection. CD7-31 was used as the template for PCR to amplify the complete  coding region of CD7 with Hind3 and Xho1 sites added to the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;  ends, respectively.

We assessed  whether these two motifs function as basal-lateral sorting  determinants for E-cadherin. All tyrosine residues in each  motif of canine E-cadherin were mutated into alanine in  region 1 (BL1), or region 2 (BL2), or both (BL12); similar  mutations in both motifs of LDL-R resulted in random  sorting to the cell surface in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matter et al.,  1992</xref>). Each mutant was epitope-tagged with the SV-40  large T antigen epitope (KT3 tag, amino acid sequence  KPPTPPPEPET; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">MacArthur and Walter, 1984</xref>) and  stably transfected into MDCK cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Confluent  monolayers of cells were grown on Transwell&#x02122; filters for  7 d, and then labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 1 h. At the end  of the 1 h labeling period, the first wave of newly synthesized E-cadherin that arrived at the apical or basal-lateral  membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shore and Nelson, 1991</xref>) was detected by cell  surface biotinylation.

This  result indicates that the basal-lateral sorting determinant(s) of E-cadherin are different from those of LDL-R.  To further dissect basal-lateral sorting determinants in  E-cadherin, we next examined the overall localization of  the basal-lateral sorting determinant in the whole molecule.</p><p>A secreted form of E-cadherin (E-cad<sup>sol</sup>), in which the  transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (CYT) domains  had been deleted, was expressed stably in MDCK cells  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Delivery of newly synthesized E-cad<sup>sol</sup> to different  membrane domains was detected by sampling apical and  basal-lateral medium for <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys labeled E-cad<sup>sol</sup>.  Note that E-cad<sup>sol</sup> was efficiently secreted into the culture  medium, did not associate with the cell surface of MDCK  cells, and did not disrupt TER (Y.-T. Chen, unpublished  result).

Normally, GP2 is attached to the membrane via a GPI anchor,  and is delivered exclusively to the apical domain of  MDCK clone II/G cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Mays et al., 1995</xref>). A deletion mutant of GP2 that lacked the GPI modification signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>  A, GP2&#x00394;GPI) was expressed in MDCK cells. As shown in  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A, newly synthesized GP2&#x00394;GPI was secreted equally  into both the apical and basal-lateral medium. This result  confirms that GP2 sorting to the apical membrane requires the GPI-anchor (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Mays et al., 1995</xref>), and reveals  that the extracellular domain of GP2 does not contain specific sorting signals for the basal-lateral membrane.</p><p>GP2&#x00394;GPI was fused to the TM and CYT of E-cadherin,  producing the chimeric protein GP2CAD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B).

Each  mutant was designed to explore whether distinct features/ activities of the cytoplasmic domain, such as binding to  &#x003b2;-catenin and individual putative sorting signals, could be  separated from each other.</p><p>In general, two types of deletion mutants were constructed. The first type involved the introduction of simple  truncations in the cytoplasmic domain: GP2CAD2 contained amino acids (aa) 1&#x02013;33 of the cytoplasmic domain,  and ended at the COOH terminus of the first putative  basal-lateral sorting signal (BL1); GP2CAD4 only contained the first 4 aa of the cytoplasmic domain; GP2CAD6  contained aa 1&#x02013;99 of the cytoplasmic domain, and ended  just before the start of the previously defined minimal  &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain (see Introduction); GP2CAD7  contained aa 1&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain, and ended  at the COOH terminus of the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding  domain (aa 100&#x02013;129); GP2CAD8 contained aa 1&#x02013;115 of  the cytoplasmic domain, and ended in the middle of the  minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain; GP2CAD10 contained  almost all of the cytoplasmic domain except the COOH-terminal three acidic amino acids (EDD). The second type  of mutants were loop-out mutants in which two halves of  the cytoplasmic domain were joined after an intervening  sequence had been deleted: GP2CAD3 contained a deletion of aa 83&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain (minimal  &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain is aa 100&#x02013;129); GP2CAD5 contained aa 83&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain; GP2CAD9  contained aa 1&#x02013;33 and aa 83&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain. Rather unexpectedly, none of the mutants (GP2-  CAD1&#x02013;GP2CAD10) gave distinct sorting patterns compared with endogenous E-cadherin or GP2CAD1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).  In all cases, mutant proteins were delivered equally to  both apical and basal-lateral membranes. Note that the  relative amounts of each chimera delivered to either the  apical or basal-lateral membrane domain are directly comparable, but a comparison cannot be made between the  amount of cell surface delivery of different chimeras from  these data. However, as described above, with the exception of E-cadherin and GP2CAD1, the amount of each  chimera that reached the cell surface was &#x0003c;10% of that  synthesized.</p><p>To examine the subcellular location of each chimeric  protein, cells were grown on glass coverslips and processed  for immunofluorescence. An anti-GP2 antibody was used  to examine the distributions of the GP2CAD chimeras,  and to distinguish them from endogenous E-cadherin. As  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A, GP2CAD1 was localized mainly at the  cell surface, including cell&#x02013;cell contact sites, similar to endogenous E-cadherin. In contrast, staining of all other chimeric proteins (GP2CAD2&#x02013;GP2CAD10) revealed an intracellular, reticular staining pattern; only staining for  GP2CAD10 is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B, but the staining of other  chimeric proteins (GP2CAD2&#x02013;GP2CAD9) was indistinguishable from that of GP2CAD10 (Y.-T. Chen, unpublished results). In addition, larger, punctate structures  were stained for GP2CAD10. The reticular pattern of  GP2CAD10 staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B), and other GP2CAD mutants was very similar to that of the ER resident protein  BiP in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bush et al., 1997</xref>). It was distinct from  the Golgi revealed by NBD-ceramide staining of fixed  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Pagano et al., 1989</xref>), and lysosomes revealed by labeling live cells with acridine orange (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> D;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Palmgren, 1991</xref>). Thus, the majority of GP2CAD10 is  most likely localized to the ER.</p><p>To confirm biochemically that GP2CAD1 deletion mutants were retained in the ER, we examined the sensitivity  of GP2CAD10 to digestion by endoglycosidase H (endo  H). GP2CAD10 MDCK cells were incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-  Met/Cys for 24 h to label proteins to steady state. Total  cell lysates were prepared, and GP2CAD10 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GP2 antibody and then subjected to  endo H digestion. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, endo H digestion resulted in a significant increase in electrophoretic mobility  of the major GP2CAD10 protein band. Note that the electrophoretic mobility of a minor protein band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, asterisk) was not affected by incubation with endo H. This upper band appears to be specific to the GP2 antibody as a  minor protein with a slower electrophoretic mobility was  also present in other GP2 chimeric protein immunoprecipitates. It is likely that this protein band represents a small  portion (&#x0223c;10%) of the chimeric protein that exited the  ER and had undergone processing in the Golgi to remove  the high mannose carbohydrate chain. From the data on  the sensitivity of GP2CAD10 to endo H digestion, we conclude that at steady state &#x0003e;85% of GP2CAD10 retained  high mannose carbohydrate chains and had not undergone  further processing consistent with its location in the ER. </p></sec><sec><title>Truncations of E-Cadherin Cytoplasmic Domain Result  in both Reduced Cell Surface Delivery and Random  Sorting to Plasma Membrane Domains</title><p>The difference in staining patterns of GP2CAD1 and  GP2CAD10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) might reflect differences in the efficiency of protein passage through the secretory pathway.  Therefore, we compared the kinetics of cell surface delivery of newly synthesized GP2CAD1, GP2CAD10, and endogenous E-cadherin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). MDCK cells stably expressing GP2CAD1 or GP2CAD10 were grown on Transwell&#x02122;  filters for 7 d, pulse labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 20 min,  and chased in DMEM containing an excess of nonradioactive Met/Cys for 40 min. At the end of the chase period, either whole cell lysates were collected, or cells were treated  with the plasma membrane-impermeant biotinylating  agent NHS-SS-biotin before lysis. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody specific to rat GP2; biotinylated proteins were further precipitated with immobilized  avidin. Identical experiments were performed with parental MDCK cells to examine the kinetics of endogenous  E-cadherin delivery to the plasma membrane. </p><p>As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, 25.9 &#x000b1; 1.3% of newly synthesized  endogenous E-cadherin, 23.0 &#x000b1; 1.8% of GP2CAD1, and  6.8 &#x000b1; 3.1% of GP2CAD10 reached the cell surface. Note  that the percentage of protein detected by cell surface  biotinylation represented only the fraction of newly synthesized protein delivered from the ER to the plasma  membrane in the 40-min chase period. Thus, the amount  of GP2CAD1 delivered to the cell surface was similar to  that of endogenous E-cadherin, while the amount of  GP2CAD10 delivered to the cell surface was considerably  lower than that of either GP2CAD1 or E-cadherin.</p><p>The difference in the amount of cell surface delivery of  GP2CAD10 and GP2CAD1 (or endogenous E-cadherin)  was also reflected in the steady state distribution of these  proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B). GP2CAD1 and GP2CAD10 expressing cells were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys to steady state for  24 h. Parallel cultures were either extracted immediately,  or biotinylated on both apical and basal-lateral membranes. Biotinylated and non-biotinylated proteins were  isolated as described above. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> B, the  amount of biotinylated cell surface GP2CAD1 was &#x0223c;90%  of the total GP2CAD1 extracted from cells. In contrast,  the amount of biotinylated GP2CAD10 was &#x0223c;7% of the  total amount of GP2CAD10. Since the extracellular domain of GP2CAD1 and GP2CAD10 were identical, the  difference in the amount of cell surface exposed proteins is  unlikely to be due to a difference in the efficiency of protein biotinylation. We conclude that GP2CAD1 rapidly  and efficiently exits the ER and is delivered to the basal-lateral membrane. In contrast, &#x0223c;90% of GP2CAD10 is retained in the ER, while the remainder slowly leaks out into  the secretory pathway and is delivered to both apical and  basal-lateral membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of aLLN and Chloroquine on GP2CAD1 and  GP2CAD10 Degradation</title><p>The data presented above show that nearly all of  GP2CAD10 is retained in the ER, whereas nearly all  GP2CAD1 is localized in the plasma membrane. It is generally acknowledged that misfolded secretory proteins retained in the ER are degraded through the proteasome  pathway (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Coux et al., 1996</xref>). To examine degradative pathways, cells were pulse-labeled with  <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys for 15 min and then chased in an excess of  nonradioactive Met/Cys for 225 min in the presence of either chloroquine phosphate (a lysosome inhibitor) or  N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (aLLN, a 26S proteasome  inhibitor). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> (upper panels), 70% of  newly synthesized GP2CAD1 remained at the end of the  chase period in the presence of chloroquine, compared  with 40% in its absence. By comparison, &#x0223c;50% of  GP2CAD10 remained in the presence of chloroquine  compared with 42% in its absence. In the presence of  aLLN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, bottom panels), 82% of GP2CAD1 remained compared with 50% in its absence; 83% of  GP2CAD10 remained in the presence of aLLN, compared  with 60% in its absence. These results show that chloroquine phosphate suppressed degradation of both GP2CAD1 and GP2CAD10 but the effect on GP2CAD1 was  greater. On the other hand, aLLN had a more inhibitory  effect on the degradation of GP2CAD10 than did chloroquine, while both aLLN and chloroquine suppressed the  degradation of GP2CAD1. </p></sec><sec><title>E-Cadherin Binding to &#x003b2;-Catenin Is Coupled to  Efficient ER Exit and Basal-lateral Membrane Delivery</title><p>The GP2CAD1 mutants were designed to test whether  binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and basal-lateral membrane delivery could be  separated from each other. GP2CAD1, GP2CAD5, GP2-  CAD7, GP2CAD9, and GP2CAD10 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) were predicted to bind &#x003b2;-catenin since they contained at least aa  83&#x02013;129 of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin which  covers the previously defined minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding  domain (aa 100&#x02013;129; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler, 1994</xref>).</p><p>The GP2CAD1/catenin complex was coimmunoprecipitated with GP2 antibody and subjected to a high stringency wash in buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium  deoxycholate, and 1 M NaCl (High Stringency Wash  Buffer, see Materials and Methods). Note that under this  wash condition the stoichiometry of the coimmunoprecipitated complex of GP2CAD1/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin was &#x0223c;1: 1:1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), similar to that of the endogenous E-cadherin/ catenin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ozawa and Kemler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hinck et al.,  1994a</xref>; see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that neither  GP2CAD10 nor GP2CAD7 bound catenins under these  conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>), although both chimeras contained the  previously mapped minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain of  E-cadherin (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similar results were obtained with  GP2CAD5 and GP2CAD9 (Y.-T. Chen, unpublished results). Catenins were not coimmunoprecipitated in a complex with either GP2CAD8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) in which the COOH-terminal half of the &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain had been  deleted, or GP2CAD3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>) in which the &#x003b2;-catenin  binding domain had been completely deleted. Overall,  there is a strong correlation between lack of &#x003b2;-catenin  binding to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, and retention of the majority of each GP2CAD1 mutant in the  ER. Note that Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> also reveals a difference in the apparent molecular mass of GP2CAD1 and all other GP2CAD  mutants. It is likely that this is due to differences in complex carbohydrate modifications between the proteins.  GP2 is known to undergo extensive N-linked glycosylation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hoops and Rindler, 1991</xref>). We show here that GP2CAD1  is efficiently delivered to cell surface and, thereby, receives extensive carbohydrate modifications during trafficking through the secretory pathway. In contrast, all  other GP2CAD mutants are retained in the ER and,  therefore, do not undergo complex carbohydrate modifications. </p><p>We also examined &#x003b2;-catenin binding to E-cadherin mutants in which putative basal-lateral sorting motifs has  been mutated (Tyr&#x02192; Ala), and an E-cadherin chimera  formed with another protein, human CD7. Stable MDCK  cell lines expressing E-cadherin BL1, E-cadherin BL2, or  E-cadherin BL12 were labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Met/Cys to steady  state for 24 h, and mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with the monoclonal antibody KT3 under the stringent wash conditions used above. All three Tyr-to-Ala  mutants of E-cadherin (BL1, BL2, and BL12) bound  &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x003b1;-catenin under high stringency wash conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>); note that these mutants were rapidly exported from the ER and sorted efficiently and specifically  to the basal-lateral membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>We placed the putative minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain (aa 83&#x02013;129, BB1) of E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain  on the COOH terminus of a unrelated type-I transmembrane protein, human CD7. The resulting chimeric protein  (CD7BB1) bound &#x003b1;-catenin and &#x003b2;-catenin, whereas CD7  did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>; note that aliquots of the sample were resolved by either 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE in order to obtain better separation of &#x003b1;-catenin/&#x003b2;-catenin and CD7/ CD7BB1, respectively). However, quantification of the  amounts of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-catenins bound to CD7BB1 revealed  that the stoichiometry of CD7BB1/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin  was 5:1:0.8 when normalized to the number of Met and  Cys residues in CD7BB1 and catenins; this compared with  the ratio of &#x0223c;1:1:1 for E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin or  GP2CAD1/&#x003b2;-catenin/&#x003b1;-catenin (see above). Most of CD7  and CD7BB1 was localized at the cell surface (Y.-T. Chen,  unpublished results); presumably, the cytoplasmic domain  of CD7 in the CD7BB1 chimera contains signal(s) for its  entry into the secretory pathway regardless of whether  &#x003b2;-catenin is bound or not. Trafficking patterns of CD7 and  CD7BB1 were similar in polarized MDCK cells. Approximately 60% of the cell surface delivery of both proteins  was to the basal-lateral membrane (Y.-T. Chen, unpublished results). We conclude that a domain containing aa  83&#x02013;129 is a transportable &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain in  E-cadherin, but the binding strength of &#x003b2;-catenin/E-cadherin, based on high stringency washes, is much lower than  that of &#x003b2;-catenin bound to the complete cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. Neither the BB1 domain alone nor  &#x003b2;-catenin binding, per se, specifies protein delivery to the  basal-lateral membrane. </p><p>We also expressed a truncated E-cadherin, E-cad8 (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>), containing the complete extracellular and transmembrane domains, and cytoplasmic domain up to aa 115 (i.e., a  deletion of aa 116&#x02013;151 of the cytoplasmic domain), which  is identical to the COOH-terminal deletion in GP2CAD8  (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This deletion covers the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin  binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler, 1994</xref>), and &#x003b2;-catenin is  not coimmunoprecipitated in a complex with E-cad8 (data  not shown) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler,  1994</xref>). E-cad8 was epitope tagged at its COOH terminus  with the KT3 epitope tag, which enabled us to distinguish  its distribution in cells expressing endogenous E-cadherin.  In confluent monolayers of MDCK cells, in which cell&#x02013;cell  contacts are clear (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> B), E-cad8 is not apparent at  cell&#x02013;cell contacts but is localized to intracellular compartments. The staining patterns comprise bright, punctate  structures that are present, although less abundant in cells  expressing GP2CAD10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B), and a diffuse cytoplasmic staining also similar to that of GP2CAD10 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B).  The extracellular and membrane proximal cytoplasmic domains of cadherin have been proposed to be involved in  dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shapiro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brieher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Yap et al., 1998</xref>). To test whether E-cad8  interacted with endogenous E-cadherin, we separated proteins extracted from MDCK cells expressing E-cad8 using  a Superose 6 size exclusion column. Endogenous E-cadherin eluted in fractions 13&#x02013;16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> C, see legend for  details), as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Stewart and Nelson, 1997</xref>).  However, E-cad8 eluted in fractions 16&#x02013;19 in a profile distinctively different from that of endogenous E-cadherin  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref> C). Note that E-cad8 has an apparent molecular  mass smaller than that of full-length E-cadherin, which is  consistent with the cytoplasmic domain deletion. A protein band with an apparent molecular mass greater than  that of the full-length E-cadherin probably represents the  precursor form of E-cad8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Ozawa and Kemler, 1990</xref>). We  also found an enrichment of higher molecular mass precursor forms of three other E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain deletion mutants when expressed in MDCK cells  (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How membrane proteins are sorted and delivered to different plasma membrane domains in polarized epithelial  cells is an important question. However, to date most studies have focused on single proteins that do not form a complex with subunit membrane or cytosolic proteins during  their transit through the secretory pathway. Although  these studies have identified several types of intrinsic  basal-lateral sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of a  few proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matter and Mellman, 1994</xref>), it is not known  whether they can be generalized to transmembrane proteins with heterologous binding partners.</p><p>E-cadherin is different from other type-I single-span  transmembrane protein that have been used to study sorting signals, since it forms a 1:1:1 stoichiometric complex  with two cytosolic proteins, &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x003b1;-catenin  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ozawa and Kemler, 1992</xref>). Significantly, previous studies  implied that assembly of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex occurs in the very early stage of trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ozawa  and Kemler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hinck et al., 1994a</xref>; this study). Therefore, E-cadherin must be sorted to the basal-lateral membrane in a complex with &#x003b2;-catenin. Amino acid sequences  in the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin that are superficially similar to recently described ER exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Nishimura and  Balch, 1997</xref>) and basal-lateral sorting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matter et al.,  1992</xref>) in other proteins do not have these functions in  E-cadherin. Instead, assembly of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex is the obligatory step in efficient export from  the ER, and subsequent delivery of E-cadherin to the  basal-lateral membrane of polarized MDCK cells.</p><sec><title>Defining the &#x003b2;-Catenin Binding Site in E-Cadherin</title><p>To examine domains of E-cadherin important in its sorting  to the basal-lateral membrane domain, we used a chimeric  protein approach. The chimera was composed of the extracellular domain of GP2, which is normally attached to  the membrane through a GPI-anchor, fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of E-cadherin (GP2-  CAD1). The extracellular domain of GP2, when expressed  without a membrane anchor, was secreted equally from  both apical and basal-lateral membranes, showing that this  domain does not contain specific membrane sorting signals. Using a similar approach, we showed that the extracellular domain of E-cadherin does not contain signals  that specify sorting to the basal-lateral membrane. The  chimeric protein GP2CAD1, however, was delivered directly to the basal-lateral membrane domain with a rate,  efficiency and fidelity similar to that of endogenous E-cadherin.</p><p>GP2CAD1 also formed a complex with &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-catenin  with a stoichiometry of &#x0223c;1:1:1 that was resistant to disruption with a high stringency buffer containing 0.1% SDS,  1% deoxycholate and 1 M NaCl, similar to E-cadherin.  The design of truncation mutants of GP2CAD1 used to  examine sorting signals in the cytoplasmic domain of  E-cadherin took into account a previously defined minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain that had been mapped to a  region of 30 aa, corresponding to aa 100&#x02013;129 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and  Kemler, 1994</xref>). However, we found that &#x003b2;-catenin did not  bind, under these stringent conditions, to a slightly longer  region containing this minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain,  aa 83&#x02013;129, if regions of the cytoplasmic domain around it  had been deleted (e.g., GP2CAD5, 7, 9, and 10).</p><p>We tested whether this difference between our results  and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler (1994)</xref> reflected the difference in the cell types used to express these mutants (L  cells, MDCK cells). GP2CAD1, 6, 7, 8, and 10 were transiently transfected into L cells and HEK293 cells. By immunofluorescence in both cell types, GP2CAD1 was localized to the cell surface, whereas GP2CAD6, 7, 8, and 10  were predominantly localized to the ER (Y.-T. Chen, unpublished results), similar to their locations in MDCK cells  (summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Another reason for the difference  in results might be the methods used to assess the stoichiometry of &#x003b2;-catenin binding to this minimal binding site  on E-cadherin. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stappert and Kemler (1994)</xref>, did  not quantitate the stoichiometry of the complex formed  between &#x003b2;-catenin and the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain (aa 100&#x02013;129). We found that &#x003b2;-catenin bound to a  chimeric protein composed of CD7 and aa 83&#x02013;129 of the  E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (CD7BB1), but the stoichiometry of the coimmunoprecipitated complex was &#x0223c;5:1  after a high stringency wash. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Finnemann et al.  (1997)</xref> reported the expression of three COOH-terminal  deletion mutants of <italic>Xenopus</italic> XB/U-cadherin in L cells. A  deletion of the most COOH-terminal 19 amino acids,  which would contain the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain intact, bound &#x003b2;-catenin but the adhesion function of  the truncated cadherin was interpreted to be &#x0201c;dramatically  altered.&#x0201d; We note that biochemical data presented in the  same paper (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Finnemann et al., 1997</xref>) revealed a  decrease in the avidity of &#x003b2;-catenin binding to the mutant  cadherin. Interestingly, confocal microscopy of L cells expressing XB/U-cadherin revealed that full-length protein  localized to cell&#x02013;cell contacts, whereas the truncation mutant had a distinctly different location and appeared to  have a punctate distribution. In conclusion, it seems likely  that &#x003b2;-catenin binds to a minimal domain of E-cadherin  comprising aa 100&#x02013;129, but the interaction is considerably  weaker than binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to the whole cytoplasmic  domain of E-cadherin. Reduced binding of the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin to &#x003b2;-catenin leads to intracellular  retention and reduced cell surface expression of cadherin.</p><p>The cadherin-binding domain in &#x003b2;-catenin lies within  the armadillo (arm) repeats of &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Hulsken et al.,  1994</xref>). The crystal structure of the arm repeats revealed a  rigid cylindrical super-helix of helices that form a groove  lined with positively-charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Huber et al.,  1997</xref>). The length of this groove could potentially accommodate a fully extended peptide of aa 25&#x02013;30, or a longer  peptide with local secondary structures; note that the minimal &#x003b2;-catenin binding site on E-cadherin is 29 aa and has  a pI of 3.1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Huber et al., 1997</xref>). Although structural  analysis of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin cocrystal is required  to define the interaction in detail, our recent analysis has  revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin is protected from proteolysis when it has formed a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with the &#x003b2;-catenin arm repeats (Huber,  A., D.B. Stewart, W.J. Nelson, and W. Weis, in preparation). This result is compatible with the view formed from  the present studies of &#x003b2;-catenin binding to GP2CAD1 deletion mutants in which most of the cytoplasmic domain of  E-cadherin, including the previously mapped minimal  &#x003b2;-catenin binding domain, interacts with &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Catenin/E-Cadherin Binding Is Coupled to Efficient  Exit of E-Cadherin from the ER</title><p>Using a combination of results obtained by cell surface  biotinylation, sensitivity to endoglycosidase H digestion,  immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence we have  shown that GP2CAD1 bound &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x0003e;90% entered the secretory pathway to the basal-lateral membrane. However, GP2CAD1 deletion mutants did not bind  &#x003b1;- or &#x003b2;-catenin and &#x0003e;90% remained in the ER. Previous  studies indicated that newly synthesized E-cadherin binds  &#x003b2;-catenin soon after its synthesis, and that &#x003b1;-catenin binds  to the complex when E-cadherin arrives at the cell surface  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Ozawa and Kemler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Hinck et al., 1994a</xref>). Thus, formation of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex correlates  with efficient exit of E-cadherin from the ER.</p><p>It is possible that E-cadherin has a specific ER export  signal that is deleted from the GP2CAD1 mutants. Recently, it was reported that the COOH-terminal acidic residues of VSV-G protein are involved in efficient exit of  VSV-G protein from ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Nishimura and Balch, 1997</xref>),  and that deletion of the most COOH-terminal two valine  residues of proTGF&#x003b1; resulted in the ER accumulation of  the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Briley et al., 1997</xref>). It has been suggested that  COOH-terminal acidic amino acid residues constitute an  ER export signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Nishimura and Balch, 1997</xref>). In this  regard, it is striking that our results showed that a deletion  of the COOH-terminal three acidic amino acids of GP2-  CAD1 resulted in the accumulation of the protein (GP2-  CAD10) in the ER. However, our data are not consistent  with the possibility that these, or other acidic amino acids  at the COOH terminus constitute a minimal ER exit signal. Internal deletions of the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (e.g., GP2CAD3) resulted in retention of the protein  in the ER, even though COOH-terminal acidic amino acids were intact. In general, we cannot separate the roles of  different regions/motifs as ER export signals from the  dominant requirement for high affinity binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to the whole cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin. It  seems more likely that the complex of E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin presents a conformation or motif in the cytoplasmic  domain of E-cadherin that allows efficient export of the  complex from the ER. Definitive proof of this mechanism  will require the expression of E-cadherin in a cell line  lacking both &#x003b2;-catenin and plakoglobin. ER retention of  GP2CAD1 proteins containing a truncated cytoplasmic  domain is likely to be a consequence of missfolding, due to  inhibition of &#x003b2;-catenin binding (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). These misfolded proteins are targeted subsequently for degradation  in either lysosomes or the 26S proteasome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Finally,  our analysis of the distribution of the simple deletion mutant E-cad8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">12</xref>), which was not a chimeric protein,  showed that this mutant was also localized intracellularly.  E-cad8 did not form a complex with endogenous E-cadherin despite an intact extracellular and membrane proximal cytoplasmic domain, which have been identified as potential sites for dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shapiro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Nagar  et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Brieher et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Yap et al., 1998</xref>). Thus,  E-cadherin dimerization may not occur in the absence of  &#x003b2;-catenin binding, or is dependent on E-cadherin leaving  the ER or arriving at the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Catenin Binding to E-Cadherin and Delivery of E-Cadherin to Sites of Function in the Basal-lateral  Membrane Domain of the Cell Surface</title><p>Previous studies have emphasized that sorting of transmembrane proteins to either the apical or basal-lateral  membrane occurs in the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Matter and Mellman,  1994</xref>). For example, early studies showed that influenza virus HA and VSV-G protein appeared together in vesicles  and membrane compartments until the TGN where they  appeared to be segregated into separate vesicle populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Fuller et al., 1985</xref>). Our data show that complex formation between E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and  &#x003b2;-catenin in the ER is not only coupled to efficient export  of E-cadherin but also direct delivery of E-cadherin to the  basal-lateral membrane. Note that in the absence of complex formation with &#x003b2;-catenin, a small amount (&#x0003c;10%) of  GP2CAD1 deletion mutants leaked out of the ER and  were then delivered randomly to both the apical and  basal-lateral membranes. As in the case of ER export, we  suggest that binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to E-cadherin induces a  conformation state in the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin that reveals a sorting determinant(s) that is recognized by the basal-lateral sorting machinery. Thus, &#x003b2;-catenin may function as a chauffeur to facilitate E-cadherin  transport through the secretory pathway. At present, we  cannot rule out an alternative possibility that &#x003b2;-catenin itself contains basal-lateral membrane targeting information, and that this information is recognized by the sorting  machinery for delivery of the E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin complex to the basal-lateral membrane.</p><p>That binding of &#x003b2;-catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of  E-cadherin plays an essential role in the efficient delivery  of E-cadherin to the cell surface raises the interesting possibility that ER exit is a potential regulatory point for  E-cadherin function. For example, limited availability of  &#x003b2;-catenin for binding to E-cadherin, or post-translational  modifications to &#x003b2;-catenin that reduce the affinity of  E-cadherin/&#x003b2;-catenin binding might lead to the retention  of un-complexed E-cadherin in the ER. Since the half-life  of E-cadherin is quite short (&#x0003c;5 h in MDCK cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shore  and Nelson, 1991</xref>), retention of newly synthesized E-cadherin in the ER would quickly result in reduced cell surface expression of E-cadherin and, consequently, reduced  cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. We note that &#x003b2;-catenin is a component  of the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway in which regulation  of &#x003b2;-catenin levels is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cadigan and Nusse, 1997</xref>).  Significantly, there is evidence that changes in &#x003b2;-catenin  levels leads to changes in steady state and cell surface levels of cadherins, and increased cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell  adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bradley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hinck et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Yanagawa et al., 1997</xref>). These effects on cadherin could be mediated by the availability of &#x003b2;-catenin for binding to cadherin in the ER, which regulates cadherin entry into the  secretory pathway and, therefore, the amount of cadherin  available for adhesion functions at the cell surface.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Amino acid sequence comparison of the basal-lateral  membrane sorting determinants in human LDL receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Matter  et al., 1992</xref>), and putative basal-lateral sorting determinant(s) in  the cytoplasmic domain of canine E-cadherin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB9802069.f1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Truncations of the cytoplasmic domain  of E-cadherin result in accumulation of mutant  proteins in the ER.
