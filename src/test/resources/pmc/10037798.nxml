These tissues are largely comprised of polymerized adhesion proteins such as fibrin and fibronectin or their fragments. Nonactivated lymphoid  cells attach preferentially to polymerized ECM proteins yet are unable to attach to monomeric forms or  fragments of these proteins without previous activation.  This adhesion event depends on the appropriate spacing of integrin adhesion sites. Adhesion of nonactivated  lymphoid cells to polymeric ECM components results  in activation of the antigen receptor-associated Syk kinase that accumulates in adhesion-promoting podosomes. In fact, activation of Syk by antigen or agonists,  as well as expression of an activated Syk mutant in lymphoid cells, facilitates their adhesion to monomeric  ECM proteins or their fragments. These results reveal a  cooperative interaction between signals emanating  from integrins and antigen receptors that can serve to  regulate stable lymphoid cell adhesion and retention  within a remodeling ECM.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>protein tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>L<sc>ymphocytes</sc> traverse between the tissue and circulatory compartments in a regulated manner requiring the expression of cell adhesion receptors and  their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Springer, 1994</xref>; Butcher and Picker, 1996).  Chronic inflammatory diseases are marked by both the  deposition of provisional extracellular matrix (ECM),<sup>1</sup>  such as fibrin, and the accumulation of lymphocytes within  affected tissues (Postigo, 1993). Lymphoid adhesion and  migration on purified ECM components is largely dependent on integrins, heterodimeric (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) proteins that integrate extracellular interactions of cells with internal signal-transducing elements, including the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aplin  et al., 1998</xref>). Lymphoid integrins, like those on other hematopoietic cells, are regulated at both the level of expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Springer, 1994</xref>), suggesting that lymphoid cell interaction with, and adhesion to, ECM proteins  is itself dependent upon initiating signaling events.</p><p>The induction of lymphoid adhesion in vitro has been  associated with the activation of a variety of signaling molecules, yet in most cases these stimuli result in transient  adhesion. However, it remains unclear how sustained lymphoid interaction with the ECM is maintained in vivo. Although conformational changes in integrin structure may  occur in response to some activational protocols, these are  often associated with ligand binding itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bazzoni and  Hemler, 1998</xref>), and the precise relationship between affinity modulation and adhesion is still open to interpretation  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Stewart and Hogg, 1996</xref>).</p><p>During wound repair, cancer, and inflammation, the  ECM is comprised of provisional matrix proteins, including fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Each is capable of self-assembly and polymerization after vascular  leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dvorak et al., 1995</xref>). The rapid, organized deposition of these molecules results in binding sites for adhesion molecules, including integrins, being separated by  only nanometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Mosesson et al., 1995</xref>), which provides a  mechanism for local avidity modulation within affected  tissues. During tissue remodeling, proteolytic activity provides a complementary mechanism to digest the polymeric  ECM. Provisional ECM, when intact, is immunopotentiating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Postigo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Halvorson et al., 1996</xref>), whereas  proteolytic fragments are immunosuppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Robson et  al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Edgington et al., 1985</xref>), suggesting an important  role for ECM deposition and remodeling in lymphocyte  responses (Ratner et al., 1992).</p><p>To investigate whether the induction of a polymeric status in ECM components could facilitate lymphoid adhesion and attachment, we examined the capacity of lymphocytes and lymphoid lines to interact with polymerized or  unpolymerized ECM proteins or with structurally defined  integrin-specific ligands. Lymphoid cells required activation to adhere to unpolymerized matrix components, but  readily attached to multimeric matrix components. Lymphoid adhesion did not require affinity modulation, but  rather was dependent upon the appropriate spacing of integrin adhesive sites. Engagement of integrin by polymeric  adhesive sites initiated signaling through the hematopoietic kinase Syk. Activation of this kinase by mutagenesis  or through antigenic stimulation resulted in cellular adherence to monomeric ligand. These results provide a mechanism for cooperation between antigen receptors and integrins during the activation of lymphocyte adhesion to  the ECM.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and Cell Lines</title><p>DT40 cells deficient in Syk and those reconstituted with Syk have been  previously established (Keshvara et al., 1996). Human M21 melanoma  cells and established lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) (JY) and lymphoid  tumor cells (RPMI 8866, RPMI 8226; Ramos), with adhesion and integrin  expression as published (Felding-Haberman et al., 1992; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stupack et al.,  1992</xref>) were obtained from J. Wilkins (University of Manitoba, Manitoba,  Canada). Clone E6 of the Jurkat cell line was obtained from American  Type Culture Collection. All lines were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with glutamine/geneticin (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>) and 10% fetal bovine serum  (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO-BRL</named-content>). The DT40 cell lines were further supplemented with 1%  chicken serum (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO-BRL</named-content>). LCL were established by outgrowth of  freshly isolated, purified B cells infected with EBV-B95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Huang et al.,  1997</xref>). Murine &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells were established from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) preimmunized animals cocultured with LCMV-infected, irradiated helper cell populations as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hahn et al., 1994</xref>).  In brief, splenic lymphocytes were harvested from infected mice, and cytotoxic &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells (CTLs) established by outgrowth in the presence of 10 U/ml  murine interleukin (IL)-2 and irradiated LCMV-infected autologous  helper cells. Cells were used in the assay after 5 d in culture. Sorted human  lymphocytes expressing integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 were isolated from PBMC after ficoll-hypaque differential gradient purification followed by flow cytometry  (FACStar&#x02122;; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="becton">Becton Dickinson</named-content>) using murine monoclonal P4C10 (5 &#x003bc;g/ ml) purified from the hybridoma and rabbit antisera to integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (1: 1,200), detected with secondary goat anti&#x02013;mouse (PE-conjugated) or goat  anti&#x02013;rabbit (FITC-conjugated) preadsorbed antisera, respectively (Southern Biotechnology). Populations expressing high levels of both integrins  were principally monocytes and were identified and excluded by forward  scatter, side scatter, and fluorescence (phycoerythrin [PE]) gating. Analysis of these populations with direct-labeled (FITC-conjugated) reagents 24 h  later confirmed these cells were a mixed lymphocyte population (&#x0223c;65%  CD19&#x0002b;, &#x0223c;20% CD3&#x0002b;) without monocytes (CD14&#x02212;) or progenitor cells  (CD38&#x02212;).

In brief, cells were  suspended at 10<sup>6</sup>/ml in RPMI 1640, 1.0% BSA. 200-&#x003bc;l aliquots of cells  were added to wells which had been precoated overnight with the specified ligands in PBS, pH 8.0, at 4&#x000b0;C and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with RPMI, 3% BSA (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>). Fibronectin (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO-BRL</named-content>) and  pronectin (Stratagene) were purchased; superfibronectin and monomeric  vitronectin were gifts of E. Ruoslahti (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla,  CA) and D. Sieffert (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Recombinant, pentameric penton base (PB) was expressed in insect cells as  described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Wickham et al., 1993</xref>). Monomeric PB integrin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Mathias et al., 1994</xref>) was the gift of T. Muir (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Adhesion was allowed to proceed for  30 min at 37&#x000b0;C followed by washing to remove nonadherent cells and then  quantitation of adherence by staining adherent fractions with crystal violet (0.1% in 0.15 M NaCl, 20% ethanol). Cell-bound stain was resolubilized in methanol and quantitated at 600 nm. Soluble fibrin was formed by  the addition of 0.2 U thrombin in DME (50 U/ml stock) (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="calbiochem">Calbiochem-Novabiochem</named-content>) to the specified fibrinogen (American Diagnostica) concentrations during coating. The addition of thrombin to BSA- or fibrinogen-coated wells served as a control and did not differ from thrombin-free  coated surfaces. Molar concentrations of pentameric PB were calculated  based upon the five individual molecules within each pentamer (therefore,  five integrin-binding sites). To express PB concentration as an aggregate  unit (pentamer), concentration may be reduced fivefold. Purified lymphocyte adhesion to substrate-coated chamber slides was quantitated by direct counting of six fields at 100&#x000d7; after sorting on a FACStar&#x02122; (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="becton">Becton  Dickinson</named-content>). Three independent sorts were performed. Adhesion to cryosections from three different sources was performed with Cell Tracker  Green-labeled LCL (5 &#x003bc;M for 15 min; Molecular Probes) in binding  buffer (DME, 3% BSA, 100 U/ml heparin) as previously described  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Stamper and Woodruff, 1976</xref>) and was quantitated similarly.</p></sec><sec><title>Radioimmunoassay</title><p>Adhesion plates (48 well) were coated exactly as described for the adhesion assay and blocked with 1.0% BSA in DME (assay buffer) for 1 h at  37&#x000b0;C.

DAV-1 was radiolabeled with [<sup>125</sup>I] (ICN) using Iodobeads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific binding of DAV-1 (&#x0003c; 1%) was assessed after 1 h.

Wells were probed by the addition of  soluble, biotinylated integrin generously provided by S.L. Goodman  (Merck KGaA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Mehta et al., 1998</xref>) for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C, washed with PBS five  times, and then bound integrin was detected by the addition of secondary  horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin secondary antibody (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>).  After four further washes, the chromogenic substrate 3,3&#x02032;, 5,5&#x02032;-tetramethyl  benzidine (Bio-Rad) was added and absorbance quantitated at 450 nm after a 10-min incubation.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Activity</title><p>LCL were washed twice in PBS, then aliquots (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> in 4,000 &#x003bc;l) were  plated for 15 min in DME on surfaces coated with different substrate as  indicated. Excess media was then aspirated, leaving the bulk of the cells  (adherent and nonadherent) in the final 800 &#x003bc;l. Cells were lysed by the addition of 700 &#x003bc;l 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-buffered lysates, pH 7.4,  containing 2&#x000d7; protease inhibitor cocktail (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="boehringer">Boehringer Mannheim</named-content>) 2 mM  PMSF, 2 mM EGTA, and 2 mM sodium vanadate (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sigma">Sigma</named-content>). Specific kinases were immunoprecipitated after preclearing lysates with protein  A&#x02013;Sepharose (Pierce) by the addition of monoclonal antibody 4D10 (Syk)  (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sbct">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</named-content>), or polyclonal antisera against phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI[3]K)&#x02013;p85 (Grb-1) (Upstate Biotechnology) or Syk (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sbct">Santa  Cruz Biotechnology</named-content>) (2&#x02013;4 &#x003bc;g/ml) and the addition of protein A&#x02013; or protein G&#x02013;Sepharose, as appropriate. Alternatively, immunoprecipitations  were performed with agarose-coupled polyclonal antisera to Syk or Lyn  (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="sbct">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</named-content>). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved  by 10&#x02013;12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylene difluoride membranes to facilitate phosphotyrosine analysis via immunodetection with  monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) and PY72 (prepared from the hybridoma). Similarly, Syk or Lyn autophosphorylation  activity was determined from the immunoprecipitates as described by the  addition of exogenous &#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P-ATP (5 &#x003bc;Ci; ICN) in kinase buffer (20 mM  Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Burg et al.,  1994</xref>). All activity was normalized by reprobing to account for small variations in protein loading of individual lanes. The p85-associated PI(3)K activity was determined after immunoprecipitation by the addition of exogenous &#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P-ATP and (4,5) PIP<sub>2</sub> substrate (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="calbiochem">Calbiochem-Novabiochem</named-content>)  followed by silica gel thin layer chromatography (1:1:1, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>OH,  HCl [1 M]) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Li et al., 1998</xref>) and subsequent visualization via autoradiography or ImageQuant phosphorimager analysis  (Molecular Dynamics).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nonadherent Lymphoid Cells Spontaneously Attach to  Tissue-immobilized ECM</title><p>Lymphoid cells can be detected in association with the  ECM of tumor and inflammatory tissues. Fibrin, a polymeric constituent of tumor ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dvorak et al., 1995</xref>), is  recognized by integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expressed on a subpopulation  of lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Halvorson et al., 1996</xref>). To examine  lymphoid interaction with a tumor-associated ECM, nonactivated lymphoblastoid B cells (LCL) were assessed for  their attachment to fibrin-rich cryosections of human  breast tumors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, A and B). LCL attachment localized  to regions of fibrin deposition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> C), and the observed  adhesion was significantly blocked (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> D) with monoclonal (mAb) LM609 directed to integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 (&#x0223c;65%,  Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> E), a known receptor for fibrinogen/fibrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cheresh,  1987</xref>) (and other provisional ECM components) expressed  on LCL. However, these tissues also contain other adhesive ligands for integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3. Thus, fibrin does not account for all the adhesive interactions observed. </p><p>To characterize this interaction more carefully, LCL  were allowed to attach to microtiter wells coated with either fibrin or fibrinogen. Although LCL attached to immobilized fibrin in a concentration-dependent manner,  they failed to attach to fibrinogen at all concentrations  tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A). The adhesion to fibrin, in vitro, was primarily dependent upon both &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;2 integrins, as determined using function-blocking mAbs LM609 and TS1/ 18, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). In contrast, adherent M21 melanoma cells readily attached to fibrinogen or its polymeric  form, fibrin, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A) and  this was blocked by mAb LM609 (data not shown), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Felding-Habermann et al., 1992</xref>). </p><p>M21 cells did not appear to prefer either form of fibrinogen/fibrin, suggesting that both ligand forms offered similar affinity sites for adhesion. To confirm this, the binding  of soluble biotinylated integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Mehta et al., 1998</xref>) to fibrin or fibrinogen-coated surfaces was tested. No difference in ligand capacity to support integrin binding was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C) as both ligand forms supported half  maximal integrin binding at receptor concentrations of  &#x0223c;15&#x02013;20 nM. These results suggested that polymerization  of fibrinogen to fibrin did not result in exposure of adhesive sites with increased affinity for integrin. Importantly,  preactivation of LCL by phorbol ester (Shimizu, 1996),  which has been shown to promote integrin clustering in  lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Haverstack et al., 1992</xref>; van Kooyk et al.,  1994), activated lymphoid attachment to fibrinogen, demonstrating that this ligand supported lymphoid adhesion  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D). In contrast, attachment to fibrinogen (or BSA)  was not rescued by pretreating either the plates or the  LCL with thrombin, suggesting that thrombin was not itself an activator of LCL attachment (data not shown).  LCL also gained the ability to bind unpolymerized fibronectin or vitronectin after exposure to PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> D).  However, in all cases examined, multivalent and polymerized forms of fibronectin and vitronectin, like fibrin, supported LCL adhesion without previous stimulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>  D) suggesting that LCL adhesion was inducible by polymeric integrin ligands, and that this may be a general property of lymphoid cell integrins.</p></sec><sec><title>Multivalent Integrin Ligands Mimic Polymeric ECM  and Facilitate Lymphoid Adhesion</title><p>To further establish the structural basis of lymphoid-mediated integrin function, LCL were allowed to attach to one  of two structurally-defined &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 ligands. In this case, microtiter wells were coated with a substrate comprised of either a monovalent or pentavalent form of the adenovirus  PB protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Mathias et al., 1994</xref>). The pentavalent form of  PB contains five available &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-binding sites equally separated by &#x0223c;60 &#x0212b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Stewart et al., 1997</xref>), whereas the monomeric construct contains only a single &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3-binding site  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Mathias et al., 1994</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A, the adherent  M21 cell line attached to either form of PB, whereas LCL  selectively attached to the pentamer. Adhesion to multimeric PB was entirely dependent on integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, since  either LM609 or a peptide antagonist of this integrin  completely blocked adhesion while antibodies to other integrins showed no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B). The addition of soluble  monomeric or multimeric PB also disrupted adhesion (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B), indicating that either form of PB was an effective soluble inhibitor of integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3. </p><p>Examination of the role of ligand density in adhesion to  the pentamer revealed that LCL adhesion was dose-dependent with a half-maximal coating concentration of 10 nM  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> C). In contrast, LCL adhesion to the monomer  could not be achieved at up to a 500-fold increased coating  concentration unless the cells were first activated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>  C). The available density of adhesive sites were determined by radioimmunoassay with a monoclonal antibody  specific for the IRGDTFAT adhesive sequence within the  integrin-binding domain of PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Stewart et al., 1997</xref>). Significant adhesion to the pentamer was observed at concentrations where only 125 adhesive sites/mm<sup>2</sup> were available,  yet no adhesion occurred on monomer-coated wells where  more than 800 sites/mm<sup>2</sup> were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D). The  failure of LCL to attach to the monomer was therefore not  due to limiting availability or absolute density of adhesive  sites. These findings suggest that it is the relative spatial  distribution of the integrin adhesive sites that facilitates  LCL adhesion to substrate.</p><p>Integrin organization on the cell surface may be an important factor contributing to adhesion, since the activation of LCL attachment to monomeric PB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B) did  not influence &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression (our unpublished data).  Lymphoid integrins can be activated by conformational  (affinity) changes by a variety of reagents, including manganese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bazzoni and Hemler, 1998</xref>). Manganese activated  the attachment of LCL to monomeric PB similarly to  PMA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A), and caused conformational changes in  integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 which were detected with monoclonal antibody ligand-induced binding site (LIBS)-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B)  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Frelinger et al., 1990</xref>). Although LIBS-1 detects the ligand-occupied form of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, the presence of manganese  elicited conformational changes which exposed this epitope on LCL even in the absence of ligand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, top).  In contrast, LCL activated with PMA did not differ from  basal LIBS-1 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, bottom). Further, PMA  did not stabilize integrin binding of soluble ligand (a relative measurement of affinity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Frelinger et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Filardo et al., 1995</xref>). Nonactivated or PMA-activated LCL  were allowed to bind PB monomer, and LIBS-1 was used  to detect ligand binding as a function of ligand concentration. No difference in half-maximal ligand occupancy was  evident between PMA-activated and untreated LCL for  soluble monomeric PB (&#x0223c;1.5 &#x003bc;M) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C). We observed  that LCL displayed the same relative affinity for ligand as  determined for M21 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C) and other adherent  cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Filardo et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, activation of LCL by  PMA leading to stable adhesion on monomer does not appear to result from preexisting affinity changes. </p></sec><sec><title>Preferential Attachment to Multimeric Integrin  Substrate Is Conserved in Lymphoid Cells</title><p>Importantly, other LCL and nonadherent B and T lymphoid cells, such as RPMI 8866, RPMI 8226, and Jurkat,  also attached selectively to multimeric &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 ligands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  A). In each case, attachment could be inhibited with monoclonal antibody LM609 (data not shown). In contrast, B  cell tumor lines which do not express &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 such as DT40  and Ramos, failed to attach to either form of PB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>  A). Although integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 has been described in tissue-associated lymphocyte populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Halvorson et al.,  1996</xref>), it is only minimally expressed on circulating lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Hemler, 1990</xref>). However, when the subpopulation of lymphocytes expressing &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 were isolated from  peripheral blood (&#x0003c; 2%) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B, inset), these cells also  demonstrated selective adhesion to both multimeric PB  and fibrin relative to monomeric PB and fibrinogen, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). Thus, lymphocytes which express appropriate receptors can attach to multivalent ligands without a requirement for exogenous activation. </p></sec><sec><title>Tyrosine Phosphorylation of p85 and Syk Follows  Integrin Contact with Ligand</title><p>It has been previously reported that agonists can facilitate  both lymphoid and platelet &#x0201c;outside-in&#x0201d; signaling through  the activation of signaling intermediates including Syk,  FAK, and PI(3)K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Shattil et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Ma et al., 1997</xref>;  Rabinowich et al., 1997). Although nonactivated LCL are  capable of recognizing monomeric integrin ligands in solution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C), the specific presentation of immobilized  multimeric adhesive sites was required to facilitate stable  adhesion. This suggests that integrin-dependent signaling  may be sufficient to initiate postreceptor-binding events  that lead to stable lymphoid cell adhesion. Kinetic analysis  showed that LCL adhesion occurred principally (&#x0223c;75%)  during the initial 5&#x02013;15 min (data not shown). Therefore,  to investigate possible mechanisms leading to adhesion,  lysates from LCL plated on monomeric or multimeric  ligands for 15 min were subjected to immunoprecipitation  and phosphotyrosine analysis.</p><p>Although LCL failed to express detectable levels of  FAK (data not shown), they expressed both Syk and  PI(3)K. Attachment of LCL to pentavalent PB resulted in  enhancement of Syk phosphorylation compared with Syk  isolated from cells plated on the monomeric substrate or  on BSA (4.5 &#x000b1; 1.7 fold) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A). Importantly, there was  a corresponding two- to threefold increase in Syk kinase  activity in cells adherent to the pentamer compared with  cells plated on the monomer or the nonadherent substrate  protein BSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B). In contrast, an increase in phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI(3)K (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> C) and  PI(3)K activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> D) was observed in cells interacting  with either pentamer or monomer relative to cells plated  on BSA. These data suggest that lymphoid cell PI(3)K becomes activated with a low threshold of integrin ligation in  general, whereas integrin ligation leading to (stable) adhesion is specifically associated with activation of Syk. </p></sec><sec><title>Syk Activity Regulates Integrin-mediated Attachment  by LCL</title><p>As an initial approach to testing whether Syk was involved  in regulating adhesion to the ECM, LCL were allowed to  bind to PB in the presence of either pharmacological inhibitors known to inhibit Syk (piceatannol) or PI(3)K  (LY294002 and wortmannin). Adhesion of the LCL to PB  was blocked by piceatannol (IC<sub>50 </sub>&#x0223c;5 mM), but was only  slightly impacted by the PI(3)K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Although LY294002 treated cells attached, they exhibited reduced PI(3)K activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, inset), failed to spread  (data not shown), and were more susceptible to shear  force during washing, resulting in an apparent slight inhibition of adhesion. Similar results were obtained with an  alternative inhibitor of PI(3)K, wortmannin (increasing effect from 70&#x02013;80 nM, data not shown). Although selective  for the kinase Syk, piceatannol has pleiotropic effects on  cells, including the blockade of src family kinases at increased concentrations. However, no significant inhibition  of the related src family kinase Lyn (the major src kinase  in LCL) was found in these studies at the concentrations  of piceatannol used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, inset). </p><p>Surprisingly, if LCL were allowed to attach and spread,  no reversal of adhesion was observed after the addition of  piceatannol (data not shown), suggesting that activation of  Syk was important in the initial phase of adhesion of lymphoid cells to the multimeric ligands. Therefore, Syk localization was examined by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy during attachment. In nonadherent LCL cells  Syk is present diffusely in the cytosol and does not significantly colocalize with actin in the microspikes present  ubiquitously across the cell surface (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A, arrow). Similarly, there is only modest colocalization of Syk and actin  in adherent cells above the plane of interaction with substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> A, &#x0002b;10-&#x003bc;m Z section). However, we consistently observed colocalization of Syk and actin in the  podosome near the cell&#x02013;substrate interface during early  phases of cell attachment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> B), although this colocalization disappeared upon full cell spreading (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> C). Together, these results suggest that the activation of Syk  plays a role in the initial polarization of cells leading to  productive attachment on multimeric ligand. </p><p>These results suggest that preactivation of Syk might be  able to facilitate attachment to monomeric ligands. To determine whether nonintegrin mediated activation of Syk  could regulate lymphoid adhesion, we examined an antigen-specific response in Syk-expressing, tissue-resident T  cells. CTL cells specific for LCMV were established by  coculture with LCMV-infected, irradiated helper cells, resulting in a proliferative response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hahn et al., 1994</xref>) and  the activation of Syk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A, inset). In these CTL, Syk  activation by antigen was sufficient to facilitate attachment to either monomeric or multimeric ligands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>  A). To confirm that Syk activation was maintained in  these cells, lysates from the CTL were generated and Syk  immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine analysis performed at the conclusion of the adhesion assay. Interestingly, Syk phosphorylation was maintained in CTL populations plated on monomeric or multimeric substrate, but  this was not the case when cells were plated on the nonadhesive substrate BSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> A, inset). These results indicate that Syk phosphorylation may be maintained by ongoing adhesion, and that Syk activation correlates with  stable adhesion to monomeric ligand. </p><p>To determine if Syk activity, independent of antigen activation, was sufficient to promote attachment to ECM,  nonadherent B lymphoma cells (DT40) deficient in Syk  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kurosaki et al., 1995</xref>) were reconstituted with either wild-type Syk or activated (Y130E) Syk (Keshvara et al., 1996)  and then examined for their capacity to adhere to a monomeric substrate. Stable expression of Syk (SykWT) in Syk-deficient DT40 cells failed to promote attachment to a  monomeric fragment of fibronectin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B), however,  DT40 cells expressing the constitutively active form of Syk  (Y130E) gained the capacity to bind to the monomeric  cell-binding domain of fibronectin. Parental DT40 cells  and their derivatives lack &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 and do not attach to PB  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A), but do express &#x003b2;1 integrins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> B, inset)  which bind this region of fibronectin. Consistent with this,  adhesion was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to &#x003b2;1 integrin (data not shown). These data show that &#x003b2;1 integrin-dependent adhesion to fibronectin, like that mediated by  &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, can also be upregulated by Syk activation, and that  Syk requires activation to promote lymphoid cell adhesion  to integrin ligands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inflammatory processes are characterized by the coordinated deposition of provisional ECM and accumulation of  leukocytes within affected tissues. Lymphocyte interaction  with components of the ECM plays a crucial role in the  chronicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Postigo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Roman, 1996</xref>) and resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Edgington et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Issekutz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Hershkoviz  et al., 1994</xref>) of inflammatory processes. Lymphoid adhesion resulting from integrin-mediated recognition of  multimeric ligands such as fibrin, polymerized fibronectin,  and vitronectin, as demonstrated, provides a mechanism  whereby nonactivated lymphoid cells can become partially  activated independent of exposure to antigen or other agonists. The capacity to control adhesion by the multimerization of integrin ligands provides a means to specifically  promote the accumulation of lymphoid cells within inflammatory or diseased tissues. Within the tissues, lymphocytes may then undergo further activation by antigen or  other agonists leading to the formation of local immune  responses or alternatively egress to the draining lymph  nodes. Lymphoid activation after tissue invasion exploits  the known comitogenic activity of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Shimizu and  Shaw, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Evidence is presented that a crucial aspect to initiating  lymphoid adhesion is the functional multimerization of  binding sites for integrins. The current study used the PB  protein of adenovirus, a model ligand bound exclusively  by integrins (Wickham et al., 1994) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> B), which provided a structurally defined ligand to examine lymphoid  interactions with different substrate forms. In fact, the  intact PB pentamer is known to have five available integrin-binding sites arranged in a pentagonal array with a  separation of 60 &#x0212b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Stewart et al., 1997</xref>) allowing it to accommodate the binding of five integrins simultaneously.  We contend that, like polymerized ECM proteins, PB acts  as a clustered ligand and exploits local avidity as a means  to initiate signaling events. It is clear that the overall (general) density of interaction is not as efficient in this respect, since much higher levels of monomeric penton base  did not support adhesion. In fact, monomer coated surfaces containing 800 integrin sites/mm<sup>2</sup> were unable to  support lymphoid adhesion, whereas multimer-coated surfaces with less than 125 sites/mm<sup>2</sup> available supported  LCL adhesion. To demonstrate that the monomer could  support adhesion, PMA, an agonist which promotes lymphoid integrin clustering via a PKC-dependent pathway  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Haverstack et al., 1992</xref>; van Kooyk et al., 1994), was used  to rescue attachment to monomer coated surfaces. Alternatively, it is possible that adhesion was observed on the  multimeric proteins because the pentameric form of PB,  and of ECM proteins in general, present higher affinity  sites for integrin interactions upon multimerization. However, at least in the case of &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3/fibrinogen interaction,  this does not appear to be the case (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B). Competitive  blocking studies indicate that soluble PB monomer and  the pentamer have a similarly high affinity for integrin  (IC<sub>50 </sub>&#x0223c;18 and 5 nM, respectively) although pentameric PB  is significantly more potent at inducing integrin-mediated  signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Li et al., 1998</xref>) (Li, E., and G. Nemerow,  unpublished data). Therefore, these findings suggest that  appropriately spaced clustering of integrin ligand provides  a specific mechanism through which these postreceptor  events promote stable adhesion. The fact that adherent  M21 cells attached to either substrate suggests that lymphoid cells regulate postreceptor ligation events differently than adherent cell types.</p><p>By itself, affinity modulation of integrin function did not  appear to explain the observed agonist-induced adhesion,  since soluble integrins maintained the same affinity for either multimeric or monomeric ligand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C). It remains  possible that avidity changes in integrin (clustering) can  result in higher affinity through local packing and lateral  stabilization of ligated integrin. Such changes might not be  detected by conformational/affinity measurements such  as LIBS binding due to steric issues of accessibility. Further study will be necessary to differentiate pure affinity  changes from local packing effects. However, in addition  to activation of PKC and Rho-dependent integrin clustering<underline>,</underline> PMA activates a variety of cellular signaling pathways, and induction of integrin-mediated adhesion by this  agonist has previously been suggested to occur as a result  of postreceptor events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Danilov and Juliano, 1989</xref>). The  current investigation similarly provides evidence for postreceptor signaling events inducing attachment, and suggests basic differences in the response of lymphoid cells  and adherent cells to different ligand forms. These findings suggest that ligand polymerization may provide all  cues necessary to facilitate stable lymphocyte attachment.</p><p>Based upon these results, we propose that integrin ligation-dependent signaling impacts the ability of lymphoid  cells to attach to the ECM. Several morphological (e.g.,  cell spreading) and signaling events were observed to  occur during adhesion, including the phosphorylation of  both Syk and p85. Although p85-associated PI(3)K activity increased after interaction with PB pentamer, it  was similarly observed after contact with monomeric PB  where no stable adhesion was detected. Inhibitors of  PI(3)K did not block attachment of LCL to pentameric  PB, however, they did disrupt spreading and the extension  of processes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A and our unpublished observations).  However, some low level of PI(3)K activity may be required for adhesion, and our data supports the possibility  that activation of PI(3)K plays a crucial role in attachment  under conditions of flow/high shear. Pretreatment with  piceatannol blocked adhesion to pentamer at very low  concentrations (5 &#x003bc;M), suggesting that activation of Syk  was required to induce subsequent attachment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>),  but was not necessarily involved in spreading or maintenance of LCL adhesion. These results are supported by  the colocalization of Syk with actin during initial cell polarization/podosome formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The activation of  Syk in lymphoid cells by antigenic stimulation or by reconstitution with constitutively active mutants rescued lymphoid cell attachment to monomer-coated surfaces (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Together, these results indicate that integrin postreceptor signaling events are crucial in governing LCL adhesion, and that local clustering of ligand provides a means  to elicit integrin-mediated signaling resulting in stable attachment. Parallel studies confirmed that attachment to  PB occurred as a result of postreceptor signaling in other  cell types. For example, we were unable to observe attachment to PB with melanoma cells bearing a mutant &#x003b2;3 integrin tail (N744A), which is deficient in signaling but not  ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Filardo et al., 1995</xref>) (our unpublished observations).</p><p>The activation of the hematopoietic kinase Syk occurs  via the antigen receptor, soluble agonists, and integrin interactions with immobilized substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Burg et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Lin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gotoh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Okazaki et al., 1997</xref>). It  is clear that qualitative differences exist in the outcome after interaction with different ligands. Activation of Syk  through the antigen receptor leads to activation of MAP  kinases and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Jacinto et al.,  1998</xref>), whereas our results suggest a role for Syk in regulating adhesion. Adhesion alone was not sufficient to fully activate freshly isolated lymphocytes, since attachment to  multimeric integrin ligands did not lead to significant proliferation of nonactivated, sorted peripheral blood lymphocytes (our unpublished observations). However, after  initial antigenic stimulation, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; CTL adhesion to monomer  and pentameric ligands was observed, and Syk phosphorylation was maintained throughout the course of the adhesion. Supporting this result, coexpression of integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3  and the &#x003b6; subunit of the T cell antigen&#x02013;receptor complex  are known to be sufficient for continued &#x003b3;&#x003b4; CTL clone  proliferation and cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Halvorson et al.,  1996</xref>). The &#x003b6; subunit consists of a transmembrane domain  and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif  (ITAM)-containing docking motif which is recognized  specifically by the dual SH2 domains of Syk and its homologue &#x003b6;-associated protein (ZAP)-70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Chan and Shaw,  1996</xref>), providing a mechanism by which integrin-mediated  Syk activation pathways and antigen-stimulated pathways  may couple.</p><p>Similarities do exist in the initial signaling pathways triggered by integrins or antigen receptors, since both integrins and antigen receptors activate specific members of  the src kinase family identified as activators of Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Burg  et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Shattil et al., 1994</xref>; El Hillal et al., 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Hunter  and Shimizu, 1997</xref>). Moreover, cross-linking either antigen  receptor or integrins results in Syk activation (Rabinowich  et al., 1996), suggesting that clustering of integrins by multimeric ligand leads to Syk activation. Syk, in turn, is  known to phosphorylate cytosolic target proteins including Pyk-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Okazaki et al., 1997</xref>), &#x003b1;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Peters et al.,  1996</xref>), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Deckert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Gotoh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Teramoto et al.,  1997</xref>), supporting a mechanism for rapid cytoskeletal reorganization in lymphoid cells during both antigen presentation and adhesion to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Kupfer and Singer, 1989</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hahn et al., 1994</xref>). However, Syk is not always required  for the activation of downstream targets by G protein&#x02013; coupled receptors or other agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Wan et al., 1996</xref>).  Therefore, modulation of integrin function by chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Carr et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Laudanna et al., 1996</xref>), multimeric  ECM, and/or antigenic stimulation may potentiate adhesion via somewhat distinct signaling pathways.</p><p>In general, recognition of ECM by lymphocytes is critical to a variety of processes, including inflammation, lymphoid maturation, tissue retention, trafficking, and surveillance (Butcher and Picker, 1996). The implication of Syk  as a crucial effector of lymphocyte&#x02013;ECM interactions is interesting, since Syk-deficient lymphocytes are defective in  tissue entry and distribution, as well as in subsequent maturation steps in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Turner et al., 1994</xref>). Thymic maturation of T cells requires both integrins (Crisa et al., 1995)  and Syk kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>). Taken together,  these observations reveal a mechanism whereby lymphoid  responses are modulated by the local composition of the  ECM, and specifically by the multimeric presentation of  integrin binding sites. Integrin-mediated adhesion to polymeric ligands plays a key role in modulating lymphoid responses through the central kinase Syk, which in turn exerts pleiotropic effects upon lymphoid cells. This interplay  may be important in the understanding of lymphoid cell  behavior in vivo, and suggests a prominent role for the local ECM in governing lymphoid behavior in malignancy  and inflammatory processes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Colocalization of  LCL attachment with fibrin  deposition in tissue sections.

(A) The attachment of LCL to monomeric PB substrate (200 nM)  was assessed in untreated  cells or in the presence of  PMA (20 ng/ml) or manganese chloride (5 mM). (B)  Manganese-treated LCL with  rescued adhesion were tested  for relative expression of the  LIBS-1 neoepitope, an indicator of conformational  changes in &#x003b2;3 integrin associated with ligand binding. Increased FITC&#x02013;LIBS-1 binding (indicating integrin conformational change) was detected by FACS&#x02122; in manganese-treated LCL (black histogram, upper panel) relative to untreated controls (light gray histogram, top) in the absence of ligand.  PMA-activated LCL (black histogram, bottom) were also compared with unactivated LCL (light gray histogram, bottom). Dark gray  indicates regions where activated or unactivated histograms overlap. (C) The influence of PMA on LCL integrin affinity was examined  using soluble ligand binding as a relative indicator. PMA-treated LCL, untreated LCL, or adherent M21 melanoma cells were assessed  for their capacity to bind soluble PB monomer as a function of ligand concentration using FACS&#x02122; analysis of FITC&#x02013;LIBS-1 binding.  The relative shift in mean fluorescence intensity is plotted for each ligand concentration as a percentage of the maximum shift observed.
