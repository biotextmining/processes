The effect of  the &#x003b2; subunit was not equivalent to raising intracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the absence of the beta subunit, suggesting that  the &#x003b2; subunit does not act by increasing all the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding rates proportionally. The &#x003b2; subunit also inhibited  transitions to subconductance levels. It is the retention of the BK channel in the bursting states by the &#x003b2; subunit  that increases the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of the channel. In the presence of the &#x003b2; subunit, each burst of openings is greatly amplified in duration through increases in both the numbers of openings per burst and in the mean  open times.

BK channels are activated by both intracellular  calcium (Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>) and membrane depolarization, and  hence can serve as an important link to couple the effects of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> and membrane potential, two common  forms of signaling in cells. To facilitate this linkage, the  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> sensitivity of BK channels, defined as the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> required for half-maximal activation at a given voltage, is  set to match the specific needs of the various cells.

The &#x003b1; (<italic>slo</italic>) subunit shows homology  with the pore-forming subunits of the voltage-dependent superfamily of K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> channels, which have at least six  putative transmembrane domains, a pore-forming region between S5 and S6, and an S4 voltage-sensor region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Atkinson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Salkoff et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Butler  et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Jan and Jan, 1997</xref>). However, the NH<sub>2</sub>- and  COOH-terminal ends of the &#x003b1; subunits differ from  those of the superfamily. The NH<sub>2</sub> terminus of mammalian &#x003b1; subunits displays an additional transmembrane domain, S0, that places the amino terminal into  the extracellular space and is required for the action of  the &#x003b2; subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Wallner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Meera et al., 1997</xref>).  The COOH-terminal tail is greatly extended, displays  four hydrophobic domains, and appears to provide the  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-sensing domain of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Wei et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997</xref>). The &#x003b2; subunit, with two  putative transmembrane domains, shows no homology  with other ion channel subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Knaus et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>While &#x003b1; subunits assemble as tetramers to form functional channels by themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Shen et al., 1994</xref>), &#x003b2;  subunits expressed alone do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McManus et al.,  1995</xref>). Rather, &#x003b2; subunits can associate with &#x003b1; subunits  in a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Garcia-Calvo et al., 1994</xref>), increasing the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of the &#x003b1; subunits  &#x0223c;10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McManus et al., 1995</xref>). It is the presence of  the &#x003b2; subunit that confers the greatly increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  sensitivity to BK channels in smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McManus  et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Tanaka et al., 1997</xref>). Although it is known  that the &#x003b2; subunit slows activation and deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dworetzky et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Meera et al., 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tseng-Crank et al., 1996</xref>), while having little effect on  channel open probability in the absence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Meera et al., 1996</xref>), the mechanism by which the &#x003b2;  subunit increases the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of BK  channels is not known. The &#x003b2; subunit could increase  apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity through fundamental changes  in the gating mechanism, such as by generating additional conformational states or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites. Alternatively, the &#x003b2; subunit might act by modulating the  gating of the &#x003b1; subunit to increase the rate of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  binding or to change the rates of selected transitions  among the various conformational states.</p><p>We now use the resolving power of the single-channel recording technique to differentiate among these  possible types of action by studying the kinetics of single BK channels comprised of &#x003b1; subunits alone, or of  both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. Our data suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit does not act by changing the fundamental gating  mechanism, as neither the Hill coefficients for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  binding nor the numbers of detected kinetic states entered during gating were changed by the &#x003b2; subunit.  The data also suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit had little effect  on the initial Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding steps involved in activation  of the channel, as the durations of the gaps (the long  closed intervals) between bursts of activity were little  changed. Instead, the &#x003b2; subunit increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity through selected modulation of transition rates to  retain the channel in the open and closed states that  generate the bursts of activity (bursting states), increasing burst duration 20&#x02013;100-fold. We also found that the  &#x003b2; subunit inhibited transitions to subconductance states,  and that the gating of native BK channels from cultured rat skeletal muscle was similar to the gating of BK  channels expressed from &#x003b1; subunits alone.</p></sec><sec id="Methods" sec-type="methods"><title>methods</title><sec><title>Heterologous Expression of BK Channels in Human  Embryonic Kidney 293 Cells</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors (pcDNA3) encoding the &#x003b1; subunit  (<italic>mslo</italic> from mouse, Genbank accession number MMU09383) and  the &#x003b2; subunit (bovine &#x003b2;, Genbank accession number L26101) of  BK channels, kindly provided by Merck Research Laboratories,  and also with an expression vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP, Plasmid pGreen Lantern-1; <named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="gibco">GIBCO BRL</named-content>).

Using the same promoter (cytomegalovirus) for the &#x003b1; and  &#x003b2; subunits and the GFP increased the probability that if the GFP  was expressed, the included subunits would also be expressed.  While we did not prove directly that all BK channels studied from  cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding for &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits  were indeed composed of both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits, the markedly  different bursting kinetics of BK channels from such cells (see  <sc>results</sc>) indicated that the coexpression of the &#x003b2; with the &#x003b1; subunit altered the gating of the channels.</p></sec><sec><title>Solutions</title><p>The intracellular solution contained 175 mM KCl, 5 mM TES  [<italic>N</italic>-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid] pH  buffer, and 10 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEDTA to buffer the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  (see below).

BK channels were identified by their large conductance and  characteristic voltage and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Barrett et al.,  1982</xref>). Endogenous BK channels in nontransfected HEK 293  cells were not seen, but we cannot exclude that they might exist  at a low density. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200A  amplifier (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="axon">Axon Instruments</named-content>) and stored on VCR tapes using a  VR-10B digital data recorder. The currents were then analyzed  using custom programs written in the laboratory. Single-channel  patches were identified by observing openings to only a single  open-channel conductance level during several minutes of recording in which the open probability was &#x0003e;0.4. Except for two  experiments in which patches containing two BK channels were  used to measure the effect of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> on open probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>), all  data were from patches containing a single BK channel. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20&#x02013;25&#x000b0;C).</p><p>Single-channel current records were low-pass filtered with a  four-pole Bessel filter to give a final effective filtering of typically  4.5&#x02013;10 kHz (&#x02212;3 dB) and were sampled by computer at a rate of  125&#x02013;250 kHz. The methods used to select the level of filtering to  exclude false events that could arise from noise, measure interval  durations with half-amplitude threshold analysis, and use stability  plots to test for stability and identify activity in different modes  have been described previously, including the precautions taken  to prevent artifacts in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">McManus et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">McManus and Magleby, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Magleby, 1992</xref>).

Activity in modes other than  normal, including the low activity mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Rothberg et al., 1996</xref>),  was removed before analysis, as were transitions to subconductance levels, except when the subconductance levels were being  studied specifically. The numbers of intervals during normal activity analyzed for each experimental condition ranged from  &#x0223c;1,500 to &#x0223c;200,000, with the greater numbers of intervals being  obtained for higher Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i </sub>where the channel activity was higher.</p><p>The methods used to log-bin the intervals into dwell-time distributions, fit the distributions with sums of exponentials using  maximum likelihood fitting techniques (intervals less than two  dead times were excluded from the fitting), and determine the  number of significant exponential components with the likelihood ratio test have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">McManus and  Magleby, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Colquhoun and Sigworth, 1995</xref>).

In brief, the distributions of closed-interval durations were first  fitted with, typically, the sum of five exponential components.  The closed intervals from the one to two exponential components with the longest time constants were then defined as gaps  between bursts, as there was typically a difference of one to three  orders of magnitude in the time constants separating the components generating gaps between bursts from those generating  closed intervals within bursts. A critical time was then defined to  separate closed intervals that were gaps between bursts from  those that were gaps within bursts, so that the numbers of misclassified closed intervals would cancel out. The critical time was  found to be relatively insensitive to the numbers of exponentials  used to fit the dwell-time distribution. Burst analysis was performed on data sets from single channels in which <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> was typically less than &#x0223c;0.8, since it became increasingly difficult to define gaps between bursts as the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> approached its maximum  value of &#x0223c;0.96 during activity in the normal mode.</p></sec><sec><title>Native BK Channels from Cultured Rat Skeletal Muscle</title><p>The parameters describing bursting kinetics for native BK channels from cultured rat skeletal muscle were obtained by analyzing  data from previous experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">McManus and Magleby  (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Rothberg and Magleby (1998)</xref>, which can be consulted for the experimental details.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Results"><title>results</title><sec><title>The &#x003b2; Subunit Alters the Gating of mslo as Revealed by Single-Channel Kinetics</title><p>The patch-clamp technique was used to record currents from single BK channels in patches of membrane  excised from HEK 293 cells after transfection with either the &#x003b1; subunit (referred to as &#x003b1; channels) or with  both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits (referred to as &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels).

These values are within the ranges of 2&#x02013;5 typically observed for both native and cloned BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">McManus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cox et al., 1997</xref>, and references therein).</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2; Subunit Increases Mean Open Time and Decreases  Mean Closed Time</title><p>To investigate the basis for the &#x003b2; subunit&#x02013;induced increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, we measured the observed durations of  the open and closed intervals for data obtained from  patches containing either a single &#x003b1; or an &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channel  over a range of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>. Since determinations of observed  mean open- and closed-interval duration are highly dependent on the time resolution, comparisons between  specific &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels were made only for data  obtained at the same level of filtering. Results are  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, B and C, for a representative comparison, where the &#x003b2; subunit increased mean open times  3&#x02013;7-fold and decreased mean closed times &#x0223c;10-fold  over the examined ranges of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>. Similar results were  found for comparisons between four additional &#x003b1; and  four additional &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels, each channel from a  different experiment, paired for the same level of filtering, over a range of filtering (4.5&#x02013;10 KHz).</p><p>Thus, the &#x003b2; subunit increases <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> through a dual effect of increasing observed mean open times and decreasing observed mean closed times. (It will be shown  in a later section that the decrease in mean closed  times with the &#x003b2; subunit results in large part from a decrease in the frequency, rather than the duration, of  the longer closed intervals.) At high levels of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>, and  consequently high <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>, the mean durations of the closed  intervals were brief, and the &#x003b2; subunit had less of an effect on the durations of these already brief closed intervals. We did not explore the effects of nominally zero  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>, where the &#x003b2; subunit has been reported to have  little effect on <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Meera et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2; Subunit Does Not Change the Number of Detected  Kinetic States Entered during Gating</title><p>The gating of BK channels has been described by kinetic schemes in which the channel makes transformations among a number of different kinetic states (e.g.,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">McManus and Magleby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Wu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cox et al.,  1997</xref>). To examine whether the &#x003b2; subunit changes the  number of kinetic states entered during gating, we fitted sums of exponential components to dwell-time distributions (frequency histograms) of open and closed  interval durations for four single &#x003b1; and three single &#x003b1; &#x0002b;  &#x003b2; channels. The numbers of significant exponential  components required to fit the distributions gives an  estimate of the minimum number of states entered  during gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">1995</xref>).  (Examples of dwell-time distributions will be presented  in a later section.)</p><p>Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> plots the number of significant exponential  components required to describe the open (A) and  closed (B) dwell-time distributions for &#x003b1; channels and  &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels. The estimates are plotted against the  numbers of analyzed intervals, as the ability to detect  exponential components is dependent on the numbers  of intervals analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">McManus and Magleby, 1988</xref>).  Estimates of the minimal numbers of open states (the  number of significant exponential components) ranged  from two to four for both types of channels, with the  lower estimates of two open states associated with the  smaller data sets. The mean number of detected open  states for &#x003b1; channels (3.0 &#x000b1; 0.5; mean &#x000b1; SD) was not  significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.38, Mann-Whitney test,  from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Snedecor and Cochran, 1989</xref>) from the mean  number of detected open states for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels (3.1 &#x000b1;  0.6). Estimates of the numbers of detected closed states  ranged from three to seven for &#x003b1; channels and from  four to seven for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels, with the estimate of  three associated with a small data set. The mean number of detected closed states for &#x003b1; channels (5.4 &#x000b1; 0.9)  was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.37, Mann-Whitney  test) from the mean number of detected closed states  for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels (5.6 &#x000b1; 1.0). </p><p>While it cannot be ruled out that changes in the  numbers of kinetic states did occur with the &#x003b2; subunit  but were not detected due to overlapping time constants and/or small areas of some of the exponential  components, the data in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> do indicate that the pronounced effect of the &#x003b2; subunit on channel activity did  not arise from an obvious change in the numbers of detected kinetic states entered during gating. This observation, that the &#x003b2; subunit did not change the numbers  of detected kinetic states, and the observation in a previous section that the &#x003b2; subunit did not change the Hill  coefficients, suggests that the &#x003b2; subunit may exert its effects by changing transition rates among states rather  than through fundamental changes in the gating mechanism, such as changes in the numbers of states or in  the number of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2; Subunit Greatly Increases Burst Duration</title><p>As a first step towards determining which transition  rates may be affected, we examined the effect of the &#x003b2;  subunit on bursting kinetics, since the single-channel  records in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit greatly increases the durations of the bursts. A critical gap  (closed interval between bursts of openings) was used  to identify bursts (see <sc>methods</sc>). Over the examined  range of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>, the &#x003b2; subunit increased mean burst duration 20&#x02013;100-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A), while having little effect  on the mean durations of the gaps (closed intervals)  between or within bursts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). </p><p>This marked increase in mean burst duration by the  &#x003b2; subunit was associated with pronounced increases in  both the mean open times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B) and in the mean  number of openings per burst (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C). Since the addition of each opening to a burst requires an intervening (brief) closed interval, the numbers of closings per  burst (given by one less than the number of openings  in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C) also increased dramatically. The &#x003b2; subunit&#x02013; induced lengthening of bursts decreased the fraction  of the total closed intervals that were gaps between  bursts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> D). For example, with 3.6 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>,  21.7% of the observed closed intervals were gaps between bursts for &#x003b1; channels, and this decreased to 1.8%  for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels. Since the gaps between bursts are  the longer closed intervals, this fractional reduction in  the numbers of such intervals by the &#x003b2; subunit contributes greatly towards the increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> by the &#x003b2; subunit.</p><p>Since estimates of both mean burst duration and the  mean duration of gaps between bursts were relatively  insensitive to the level of filtering, these parameters  were compared directly for five &#x003b1; channels and five &#x003b1; &#x0002b;  &#x003b2; channels, each obtained from a patch containing a  single channel, in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, E and F. The data from the 10  channels support the representative data shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, A and B, for one channel of each type: the &#x003b2; subunit  greatly increased mean burst duration while having little effect on the duration of gaps between bursts. While  there was considerable variability in estimates of mean  burst duration among channels of the same type, all of  the individual estimates of mean burst duration for &#x003b1;  channels when compared with &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels were  clearly separated at each examined Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>, differing by  at least an order of magnitude (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> E). Hence, the  magnitude of the effect of the &#x003b2; subunit on mean burst  duration was greater than the variability among channels of the same type.</p><p>Since the mean open time, the mean number of  openings per burst, and the mean duration of the gaps  within bursts were all highly sensitive to differences in  filtering, we only compared estimates of these parameters for channels that were filtered the same. Results  similar to those in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, B and C, and 4, A&#x02013;D, were  found for four such additional detailed comparisons  between &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels, paired for the same  level of filtering. In each case, the &#x003b2; subunit increased  <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> by prolonging the bursts through increases in both  the numbers of openings per burst and in the mean  open time. Prolonging the bursts also decreased the  fraction of shut intervals that were gaps between bursts  by preventing the channel from entering the longer  closed intervals that separate bursts.</p></sec><sec><title>Increasing P<sub>o</sub> with the &#x003b2; Subunit Was Not Equivalent to  Increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup></title><p>Similar to the effects of the &#x003b2; subunit on increasing  mean open time, increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> also increases mean  open times for BK channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">McManus and  Magleby, 1991</xref>) and the numbers of openings per burst  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Magleby and Pallotta, 1983</xref>). Thus, a potential mechanism for the action of the &#x003b2; subunit is that it  may increase the rates at which the channel binds the  activating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions. If the addition of the &#x003b2; subunit increases all the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates proportionally, then  &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels should display identical kinetics  when the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> is adjusted to give the same <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> for both  types of channels. To examine this possibility, we compared the dwell-time distributions of &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels at the same <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>.</p><p>Results are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, which presents open  dwell-time distributions on the left and closed dwell-time distributions on the right for both &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2;  channels, each at two different Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>. At 1.8 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub>,  the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> for the &#x003b1; channel was 0.004 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> A), while the  <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> for the &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channel was 0.15 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). The increase in <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> induced by the &#x003b2; subunit was due to both a  pronounced shift in the open intervals to longer durations and a marked decrease in the number of longer  closed intervals (gaps between bursts), as indicated by a  decrease in the amplitude of the component marked  gaps. </p><p>By increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> from 1.8 to 5.4 &#x003bc;M, the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of the  &#x003b1; channel was increased from 0.004 to 0.16 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C)  to approximate the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of 0.15 for the &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channel at  1.8 &#x003bc;M Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B). A comparison of the dwell-time  distributions for the &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels at the same  <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> showed marked differences in the kinetics: both the  mean open times and the mean durations of the gaps  between bursts were approximately an order of magnitude less for the &#x003b1; channel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> C) than for the &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2;  channel (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> B), while the relative numbers of gaps  between bursts were greater for the &#x003b1; channel than for  the &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channel. These marked differences in the kinetics of &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels at the same <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> exclude  the possibility that the &#x003b2; subunit acts by the same proportional increases in all the rate constants for Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  binding.</p></sec><sec><title>The &#x003b2; Subunit Has Little Effect on the Durations of the Gaps  between Bursts</title><p>One reason why increasing <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> with the &#x003b2; subunit was  not equivalent to increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> in the absence of the  &#x003b2; subunit was the differential effects of the &#x003b2; subunit  and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> on the gaps between bursts. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, B and D,  shows that the &#x003b2; subunit had little effect on the durations of the gaps between bursts, while decreasing their  relative numbers.

This decrease is  shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, where increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> reduced the  durations of gaps between bursts for both types of  channels.

The single-channel analysis in our study  provides insight into the mechanism for this apparent  increase in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity. We found that the &#x003b2; subunit increased burst duration 20&#x02013;100-fold by increasing  both the number of openings per burst and the mean  open times, while having little effect on the mean durations of the gaps (closed intervals) between bursts.</p><p>The bursting kinetics of channels can be described  by the highly simplified Scheme I, where <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub> is the rate  constant for entering bursts and <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub> is the rate constant  for leaving bursts. For simple models that describe the  basic single-channel properties of the gating of BK  channels, the gaps between bursts in Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FSI">SI</xref> are generated by potential transitions among three to eight  closed states, and the bursts in Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FSI">SI</xref> are generated  by potential transitions among three to four open states  and three to six brief closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Magleby and Pallotta, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">McManus and Magleby, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Wu et al.,  1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Rothberg and Magleby, 1998</xref>). Because the data  in our study were recorded from patches containing a  single BK channel, each gap between bursts represents  the sum of the dwell times in the closed states entered  between bursts for that single channel. Some of the  closed states contributing to the gaps between bursts  would be expected to bind Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, with the binding driving the channel through one or more closed states towards the first open state that terminates the gap between bursts. It is this Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> dependence of the closed  states entered between bursts that produces long gaps  between bursts at low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and brief gaps at high Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>Inspection of Scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FSI">SI</xref> suggests that the &#x003b2; subunit  could promote bursting by facilitating the entry of the  channel into bursts (by increasing <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>) or by preventing  the channel from leaving the bursts once entered (by  decreasing <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub>), or by both actions. If the &#x003b2; subunit acts  to facilitate entry into bursts, then the durations of the  gaps (closed intervals) between bursts should be decreased by the &#x003b2; subunit. Alternatively, if the &#x003b2; subunit  acts by retaining the channel in bursts once entered,  then the &#x003b2; subunit should have little effect on the durations of the gaps between bursts, but should decrease  their relative numbers since the channel would enter  the gaps between bursts less often. </p><p>Our observations that the &#x003b2; subunit increased burst  duration and decreased the numbers of gaps between  bursts (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A, and 5) while having little effect on  the durations of the gaps between bursts (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B and  5) suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit had little effect on <italic>k</italic><sub>1</sub>.  Thus, the &#x003b2; subunit increases <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> mainly by slowing <italic>k</italic><sub>&#x02212;1</sub>  to retain the channel in the bursting states.</p><p>In contrast to the relative lack of effect of the &#x003b2; subunit on the durations of the gaps between bursts, increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> decreased the durations of gaps between  bursts for both &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B, and  5).

One possibility  would be for the &#x003b2; subunit to add additional states that  are entered during the bursting. Gating in these additional states could then retain the channel in the  bursts. Another possibility would be for the &#x003b2; subunit  to add additional Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites that would act to  retain the channel in bursts. Our observations that the  &#x003b2; subunit did not change the numbers of exponential  components in the dwell-time distributions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or  the Hill coefficients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit  does not act by changing either the numbers of kinetic  states entered during gating or the effective number of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding sites. (Our observations that the number  of subunits per channel could be doubled, from four  for &#x003b1; channels to eight for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels, without  changing the numbers of detected kinetic states, indicate that the number of states entered during gating is  not necessarily related to the total number of subunits  comprising the &#x003b1; channel.)</p><p>The above findings, when coupled with previous observations that the &#x003b2; subunit does not appear to change  the effective gating charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">McManus et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Meera et al., 1996</xref>), suggest that the &#x003b2; subunit acts not  by fundamental changes in the gating mechanism,  such as alterations in either the number of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding sites or the number of major conformational  changes, but rather through modulation of the gating  of the &#x003b1; subunits.</p><p>One possible way the &#x003b2; subunit might modulate the  gating of the &#x003b1; subunits would be through changes in  the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding rates. If the &#x003b2; subunit increased all  the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates to the &#x003b1; subunits proportionally,  then increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup><sub>i</sub> sufficiently to obtain the same <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>  for &#x003b1; channels as for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels should give the  same single-channel kinetics for both types of channels.  This was found not to be the case, as the durations of  the bursts, the mean open times, the mean numbers of  openings per burst, and the durations of the gaps between bursts were all considerably less for &#x003b1; channels  than for &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels at the same <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). </p><p>Since the &#x003b2; subunit does not increase all of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates proportionally, could it act by increasing  a subset of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates? Our observation  that the &#x003b2; subunit had little effect on the durations of  the gaps between bursts suggests that the &#x003b2; subunit has  little effect on the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates to the closed  states that dominate the gaps between bursts. This observation does not exclude the possibility that the &#x003b2;  subunit may increase some of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-binding rates in  the bursting states, but such an effect would require a  differential effect of the &#x003b2; subunit on the bindings of  successive Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>If the &#x003b2; subunit does act by retaining the channel in  the bursting states, then this is functionally equivalent  to imposing a barrier to prevent the channel from leaving the bursting states. If this is the case, then the deactivation from the bursting states that occurs in the presence of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> after a step to negative membrane potentials might be expected to be slowed by the &#x003b2; subunit.  Consistent with this possibility, the &#x003b2; subunit does slow  deactivation after steps to negative membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Dworetzky et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Meera et al., 1996</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Tseng-Crank et al., 1996</xref>). </p><p>The &#x003b2; subunit of the BK channel bears no sequence  homology with accessory subunits from other channels  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Knaus et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting that modulatory subunits may have evolved separately as needed to modulate specific channels. It also appears that the &#x003b2; subunit  of the BK channel works differently from the modulatory subunits of other channels that increase expression levels and speed activation and inactivation rates  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Lacerda et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Varadi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Isom et al.,  1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Rettig et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Makita et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Heinemann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Morales et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shi et al., 1996</xref>).  However, the actions of the &#x003b2; subunit for the BK channel seem to have some features in common with the actions of the accessory Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel &#x003b2;<sub>2A</sub> subunit on Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  channels in the presence of a dihydropyridine derivative; both subunits increase burst duration, although in  the case of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel this increase occurs only  when the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel is in a high <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> mode. Interestingly, these increases in burst duration by the different  subunits on different channels occur even though the &#x003b2;  subunit of BK channels has two putative transmembrane  segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Knaus et al., 1994</xref>), while the &#x003b2;<sub>2A</sub> subunit of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels is cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Takahashi et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of the bursting kinetics of BK channels  from cultured rat skeletal muscle to the bursting kinetics of &#x003b1; channels and &#x003b1; &#x0002b; &#x003b2; channels indicated that BK  channels in cultured rat skeletal muscle have bursting  kinetics similar to &#x003b1; channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, BK channels in cultured rat skeletal muscle gate as if they are  composed of &#x003b1; subunits alone.

Similar to our observation for BK channels,  the presence of an auxiliary subunit for the ryanodine  receptor also decreases the percentage of time spent in  gating to subconductance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Ondrias et al., 1996</xref>).</p><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>From a functional viewpoint, it is the retention of the  BK channel in the bursting states by the &#x003b2; subunit that  increases the apparent Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sensitivity of the channel.  In the presence of the &#x003b2; subunit, each burst of openings  is greatly amplified in duration through increases in both  the numbers of openings per burst and in the mean  open times. The physical mechanism by which the &#x003b2;  subunit retains the channel in the bursting states is not  known, but one possibility is that selective allosteric effects of the &#x003b2; subunits on the &#x003b1; subunits facilitate some  conformational changes and/or inhibit others. This selective facilitation and/or inhibition would work to increase the effective energy barrier for leaving the bursting states, through increases in both mean open time  and the numbers of openings per bursts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Single-channel current traces recorded from BK  channels expressed from &#x003b1; or &#x003b1;  &#x0002b; &#x003b2; subunits.
