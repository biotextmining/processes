In immunoblotting analysis, a  monoclonal antibody against recombinant human Ran,  designated ARAN1, was found to recognize an epitope  in the COOH-terminal domain of Ran. In a solution  binding assay, ARAN1 recognized Ran when complexed with importin &#x003b2;, transportin, and CAS, but not  the Ran-GTP or the Ran-GDP alone, indicating that  the COOH-terminal domain of Ran is exposed via its  interaction with importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related proteins. In addition, ARAN1 suppressed the binding of RanBP1 to the  Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex. When injected into the nucleus of BHK cells, ARAN1 was rapidly exported  to the cytoplasm, indicating that the Ran&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2;&#x02013;related protein complex is exported as a complex  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in living cells. Moreover, ARAN1, when injected into the cultured cells induces the accumulation of endogenous Ran in the cytoplasm and prevents the nuclear import of SV-40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal substrates. From  these findings, we propose that the binding of RanBP1  to the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex is required for the dissociation of the complex in the cytoplasm and that the  released Ran is recycled to the nucleus, which is essential for the nuclear protein transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nuclear protein import</kwd><kwd>Ran</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>importin</kwd><kwd>microinjection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>T<sc>he</sc> intracellular transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm takes place  through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)<sup>1</sup> which  permit the passive diffusion of molecules smaller than 20&#x02013; 40 kD and also support an active and receptor-mediated  transport. The active protein import pathway which has  been studied most intensively is mediated by a basic-type  nuclear localization signal (NLS) which contains a short  amino acid stretch rich in basic amino acids. The basic-type NLS of the import substrate binds to the heterodimeric importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to form a nuclear pore-targeting complex. Importin &#x003b1; provides the NLS-binding site, whereas  importin &#x003b2; accounts for the targeting of the complex to the  NPC (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">G&#x000f6;rlich and Mattaj, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Koepp  and Silver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">G&#x000f6;rlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Nigg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Yoneda, 1997</xref>).  In addition to the basic-type NLS mediated import pathway, it is known that the import of heterogeneous nuclear  RNA-binding protein A1 (hnRNP A1) is mediated by a  signal comprised of 38 amino acids, which is referred to as  M9, and which is rich in glycine and aromatic residues. M9  directly binds to an importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor,  transportin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nakielny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Pollard et al., 1996</xref>). It has  also been demonstrated that the nuclear export of some  proteins depend on nuclear export signal (NES), which is  rich in hydrophobic residues (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Nakielny and  Dreyfuss, 1997</xref>). Nuclear export of proteins containing NES  is mediated by an importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related export receptor, CRM1  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Fornerod et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Ossareh et al.,  1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Stade et al., 1997</xref>). Although the export signal of importin &#x003b1; has not been identified, its export is also mediated  by another importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related export receptor, cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene (CAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>). These  transport factors, importin &#x003b2;, transportin, CAS, and CRM1  constitute a protein superfamily which has a Ran-GTP&#x02013; binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fornerod et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">G&#x000f6;rlich et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>A small GTPase Ran is known to be essential for the active transport pathways including the import of the basic-type NLS and M9 containing proteins or snRNPs, or the  export of importin &#x003b1;, NES-containing proteins, tRNA,  UsnRNA, and several mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Melchior et al., 1993a</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Moore and Blobel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Koepp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Nakielny et  al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Richards et al., 1997</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Avis and Clarke, 1996</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Koepp and Silver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">G&#x000f6;rlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Goldfarb, 1997</xref>).  Ran is predominantly, but not exclusively, a nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1991a</xref>). The Ran GTPase cycle is regulated by the GDP&#x02013;GTP exchange factor, RCC1,  which charges Ran with GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bischoff and Ponstingl,  1991b</xref>), the GTPase-activating protein, RanGAP1, which  converts Ran-GTP into Ran-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bischoff et al., 1994</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Becker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Corbett et al., 1995</xref>), and RanBP1 (or  RanBP2) whose binding to Ran-GTP further stimulates  the GTPase-activating activity of RanGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Coutavas et  al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bischoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al., 1995</xref>). RCC1  is a chromatin-associated nuclear protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Ohtsubo et al.,  1989</xref>), whereas RanGAP1 and its coactivator, RanBP1, are  exclusively cytoplasmic, and RanBP2 is located on the cytoplasmic fibrils of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Hopper et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Melchior  et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Bischoff et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Wu et al., 1995</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yokoyama et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Matunis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Richards et al.,  1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>). Because of this asymmetric distribution of RCC1, RanGAP1, and RanBP1/RanBP2, it  has been predicted that a steep Ran-GTP gradient across  the nuclear envelope exists (very low levels of cytoplasmic  Ran-GTP and high levels inside the nucleus). </p><p> In the case of nuclear import of proteins which contain  the basic-type classical NLS, it has been proposed that  Ran is involved in several different steps in the process. At  least a portion of the energy required for translocation  through the NPC is supplied via GTP hydrolysis by Ran  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Melchior et al., 1993a</xref>), although other GTPases may also  be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Sweet and Gerace, 1996</xref>). In addition, nuclear  Ran-GTP functions to terminate the import reaction. After the translocation of the trimeric complex, which is  comprised of importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and a karyophile with the classical NLS, through the nuclear envelope, the direct binding of  nuclear Ran-GTP to importin &#x003b2; causes the dissociation of  the trimeric complex thus releasing the cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Rexach and  Blobel, 1995</xref>; G&#x000f6;rlich et al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Moroianu et al., 1996</xref>). In  the same manner, transportin binds to its cargo only in the  absence of Ran-GTP, i.e., in the cytoplasm and releases it  in the nucleus. For the next rounds of nuclear import, importin &#x003b2; and transportin are required to return to the cytoplasm and dissociate from Ran-GTP. In contrast, the binding  of the export receptors such as CRM1 and CAS to their cargos is enhanced by the simultaneous binding of Ran-GTP,  which occurs in the nucleus. The trimeric cargo-export receptor&#x02013;Ran-GTP complex is then transferred to the cytoplasm. Thus, the binding of Ran-GTP to importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related  transport factors regulates their interaction with cargos or  adapter molecules. Therefore, it has been suggested that this  Ran-GTP concentration gradient is a critical determinant in  the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport, ensuring  that the transport factors carry their cargoes unidirectionally  (G&#x000f6;rlich et al., 1996, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;  complex is very stable and resistant to the Ran GTPase activating activity of RanGAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Floer and Blobel, 1996</xref>).  Biochemical analyses have suggested that RanBP1 directly promotes the dissociation of Ran-GTP from importin &#x003b2;, CAS, and transportin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bischoff and G&#x000f6;rlich, 1997</xref>;  Lounsbury et al., 1997). Nuclear injection of RanGAP1  significantly inhibited the export of injected importin &#x003b1;  and &#x003b2;, transportin, and NES-containing proteins in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>). As a result, it  has been proposed that the importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport  factors are probably exported to the cytoplasm as complexes with Ran-GTP, and that these complexes dissociate  and Ran is then converted to the GDP-bound form by  RanGAP1 in conjunction with RanBP1 in the cytoplasm  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bischoff and G&#x000f6;rlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>). However, direct in vivo evidence for this proposal is currently  lacking.</p><p> Unlike other small GTPases, Ran has negatively charged  amino acid residues at the COOH terminus instead of consensus sequences for lipid modification. To better understand the biological significance of the COOH-terminal domain, the COOH terminus-deleted mutant Ran, referred to  as &#x00394;DE-Ran, has been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Lounsbury et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1996a</xref>,b;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Ren et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Carey et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chi  et al., 1997</xref>). This mutant is capable of supporting the nuclear import of basic-type NLS-containing substrates in  digitonin-permeabilized semi-intact cells, whereas the &#x00394;DE-Ran, which is expressed in cultured cells has a dominant-negative phenotype for both nuclear protein import and  RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Ren et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Carey et  al., 1996</xref>). This mutant protein has a lower affinity for  RanBP1 than the wild-type (wt) Ran and binds to importin  &#x003b2; with higher affinity than wild-type Ran in an overlay assay  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Lounsbury et al., 1996b</xref>). These results suggest that the deletion of the COOH-terminal portion of Ran may be the cause of the defect in the Ran GTPase cycle. However, the issue of how the COOH-terminal  domain is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport or the  Ran GTPase cycle is not known with certainty, since the deletion in COOH-terminal domain may cause drastic conformational changes in Ran. </p><p> In this study, in order to identify functional domains of  Ran including the COOH-terminal domain, we produced  anti-Ran monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). By using one of  the anti-Ran mAbs, we provide evidence that the COOH-terminal domain of Ran is not exposed to the surface of  the molecule until Ran interacts with importin &#x003b2; or importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors, CAS and transportin. This  observation suggests that the exposed COOH-terminal acidic  sequence of Ran may be essential for the binding of RanBP1  to the Ran-GTP complexed with importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors. Furthermore, we show in vivo evidence that  Ran/importin &#x003b2; can be exported in the form of a complex  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our results indicate  that the binding of RanBP1 to the Ran/importin &#x003b2; complex in the cytoplasm, which appears to be blocked by injected mAb, is essential for the recycling of Ran and nuclear protein import.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Production of mAbs</title><p>mAbs were obtained essentially according to the procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">K&#x000f6;hler and  Milstein (1975)</xref>. 50 &#x003bc;g of denatured recombinant human Ran was initially  intraperitoneally administered with Freund's complete adjuvant to a  16-wk-old BDF1 mouse (Japan SLC), followed by three subsequent injections at 3-wk intervals with the same dose in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. 1 mo after the fourth injection, the mouse was given a booster injection of the same dose. 4 d later, spleen cells isolated from the mouse were  fused with the mouse myeloma cell line P3U1 using standard methods.

The screening of the monoclonal antibodies was based on  two criteria: (a) that they react with only Ran protein in  immunoblotting; and (b) that they show the same staining  pattern with polyclonal anti-Ran antibodies in immunofluorescence microscopy. Through this screening procedure,  we isolated only one clone, designated ARAN1, for further characterization. ARAN1 was typed using a mouse  monoclonal antibody isotyping kit as an immunoglobulin  kappa G2b. On an immunoblot, ARAN1 detected recombinant human Ran and specifically reacted with a single  25-kD band in cell extracts from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, BHK21 cells, human embryonic lung (HEL)  cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> A), Madin-Darby bovine kidney-derived epithelial cells (MDBK), and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (data  not shown), which was also detected by affinity-purified rabbit anti-Ran polyclonal antibodies. Furthermore, ARAN1  recognized a single spot by immunoblotting analysis of HeLa  total cell extracts after two-dimensional electrophoresis,  which was also detected with the anti-Ran polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). Immunofluorescent image with  ARAN1 in BHK cells showed the same typical staining  pattern as that with the anti-Ran polyclonal antibodies  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). From these findings, it was concluded that the  monoclonal antibody ARAN1 specifically binds to Ran.  </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Recognizes an Epitope at the COOH-terminal  Domain of Ran</title><p>To determine the specific epitope recognized by ARAN1,  we prepared a series of truncated forms of recombinant  Ran fused with GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A) and analyzed the interaction of these with ARAN1 by immunoblotting. Although  anti-GST polyclonal antibodies showed that all of the Ran  mutants were appropriately expressed and transferred to  nitrocellulose (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> B), ARAN1 recognized only the full-length of GST-Ran. Removal of the COOH-terminal seven  amino acids (210&#x02013;216) of Ran completely abolished the reactivity with ARAN1 in immunoblotting, suggesting that  the COOH-terminal domain, which consists of seven amino  acid residues in Ran, represents the epitope for ARAN1.  To confirm this, we prepared the 10-mer peptide of the  COOH-terminal domain, 207&#x02013;216, of Ran fused to GST  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> A). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, B and C, ARAN1 clearly  reacted with the residues between 207 and 216 of human  Ran not only in immunoblotting but also in a solution binding assay. From these findings, it was concluded that the  epitope of ARAN1 is located in the COOH-terminal portion  of Ran, which is highly negatively charged (&#x02212;DEDDDL)  and conserved among species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> D).  </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Binds to the Ran&#x02013;Importin &#x003b2; Complex But Not  the Ran Molecule Alone in Solution Binding Assay</title><p>It is known that the stable Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex  causes the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis on Ran stimulated  by RanGAP1. In contrast, Ran-GDP shows a much lower  affinity to importin &#x003b2; than Ran-GTP. To determine which  form of Ran is recognized by ARAN1 in solution, immunoprecipitation analysis of ARAN1 using recombinant  proteins was performed. Purified recombinant human  Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP was incubated with ARAN1 in the  presence or absence of importin &#x003b2; followed by the precipitation with protein A&#x02013;conjugated agarose beads. The results showed that, whereas ARAN1 precipitated neither  Ran-GTP nor Ran-GDP alone, it reacted with both Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP only in the presence of importin &#x003b2; and  precipitated both Ran and importin &#x003b2;. To clearly confirm  that ARAN1 can't recognize Ran molecule alone, precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Ran polyclonal antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> A). The molar ratio of  the Ran and importin &#x003b2; precipitated with ARAN1 was estimated to be &#x0223c;1:1 (data not shown). Since ARAN1 did  not bind to importin &#x003b2; directly in this assay, these results  indicate that ARAN1 reacts only with Ran when bound to  importin &#x003b2;, and suggest that Ran changes conformation  when bound to importin &#x003b2; which, in turn, exposes its  COOH-terminal portion.  </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Also Binds to the Ran&#x02013;Transportin Complex  and the Ran&#x02013;CAS&#x02013;Importin &#x003b1; Complex</title><p>It is well known that Ran interacts with some import and  export receptors, e.g., transportin, CAS, and CRM1, which  are members of the superfamily of Ran-GTP-binding protein/importin &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">G&#x000f6;rlich et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Fornerod et al., 1997a</xref>). Tranportin forms a complex with  Ran-GTP and CAS simultaneously binds to both Ran-GTP and importin &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kutay et al., 1997</xref>). Judging from the  conservation of the Ran-binding domain in this family, it is  likely that the COOH-terminal tail of Ran may also be exposed as the result of the interaction with these molecules.  To confirm this, we performed the solution binding assay  with different importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors, transportin, and CAS. The results clearly showed that ARAN1  binds to both Ran-GTP/transportin complex and Ran-GTP&#x02013;CAS&#x02013;importin &#x003b1; complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B), suggesting that  importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors might induce a general conformational change in Ran through their interaction. In the case of CAS, it should be noted that a slight  recognition of a complex between CAS and Ran-GTP by  ARAN1 can also be observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> B). This suggests that  CAS directly binds to Ran-GTP in the absence of importin  &#x003b1;, although the affinity is very low. </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Suppresses the Ternary Complex Formation of  Ran, Importin &#x003b2;, and RanBP1 in a Solution  Binding Assay</title><p>Both Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP form a ternary complex  with RanBP1 and importin &#x003b2; in a solution binding assay.  Although it has been assumed that RanBP1 plays a role in  the dissociation of the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex, the  biological significance of the ternary complex has not yet  been established. The RanBP1&#x02013;Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex has been proposed to play a role in nuclear protein import as a ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chi et al., 1997</xref>), although it has  not yet demonstrated how the complex functions in the nuclear protein import. We therefore examined the effects of  ARAN1 on the interaction of RanBP1 with both Ran-GTP&#x02013; importin &#x003b2; and Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complexes in the solution binding assay. In the absence of ARAN1, GST-tagged  importin &#x003b2; efficiently precipitated both Ran-GTP and Ran-GDP together with RanBP1 in a molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, A  and B, lane 1). In contrast, in the presence of ARAN1, the  amount of RanBP1 precipitated with GST-tagged importin  &#x003b2; apparently decreased, although the Ran was efficiently  precipitated. These results indicate that RanBP1 is not able  to interact with the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; and Ran-GDP&#x02013; importin &#x003b2; complexes, when bound to ARAN1. That is, the  binding of ARAN1 to the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex suppresses the ternary complex formation of both RanBP1&#x02013; Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; and RanBP1&#x02013;Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;  in solution.  </p></sec><sec><title>Ran&#x02013;Importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related Transport Factor Complex Is  Exported from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm</title><p>As described above, it has been proposed that the Ran-GTP&#x02013; importin &#x003b2; complex and Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor (such as transportin and CAS) complex are  formed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm. To  determine whether these complexes are actually formed in  the nucleus and migrate to the cytoplasm as a single entity  in living cells, ARAN1, which binds to only the Ran complexed with importin &#x003b2; and importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport  factors in solution, was injected into the cytoplasm or nucleus  of cultured BHK cells. It was found that nuclear-injected  ARAN1 was efficiently exported to the cytoplasm within  30 min of incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> A), whereas control mouse  IgG was retained in the injected nucleus (data not shown).  Since due to its size (<italic>M</italic><sub>r </sub>&#x0003d; 160,000), mouse IgG cannot  passively traverse the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Wen et al., 1995</xref>),  these results indicate that ARAN1 migrates to the cytoplasm in a piggyback fashion. These findings suggest that it  is most likely that ARAN1 binds to the Ran-GTP complexed with importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors in the nucleus, in which Ran would exist as the GTP-bound form,  and is transported to the cytoplasm as a complex with them.  That is, these results suggest that the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor complex moves to the cytoplasm as a single entity without dissociation. On the other  hand, cytoplasmically injected ARAN1 remained in the cytoplasm even after 3 h of incubation (data not shown). </p><p>To determine whether ARAN1 actually recognizes the  Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor complex in  a crude cell extract, we performed immunoprecipitation  analysis with mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cell cytosolic extract in the presence of Q69L Ran-GTP, which should stabilize the complexes of importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors and Ran-GTP in the crude lysate. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>  B, importin &#x003b2;, CAS, and transportin were coprecipitated  with the Ran from the cell lysate by ARAN1. This result  supports the view that nuclear-injected ARAN1 binds to  Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related factors and is exported from  the nucleus to the cytoplasm in vivo. </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Affects the Distribution of Endogenous Ran</title><p>Ran is localized predominantly in the nucleus. If Ran continuously shuttles between two compartments, the nucleus  and cytoplasm, and the binding of RanBP1 to the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex in the cytoplasm is required for  the recycling of Ran to the nucleus, ARAN1 would be expected to affect the distribution of Ran. To examine this  hypothesis, ARAN1 was introduced into the cell and the distribution of endogenous Ran was observed. As shown in Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, 30 min after injection into either the nucleus or the cytoplasm, injected ARAN1 localized in the cytoplasm. 30 min  after injection of ARAN1 into either the nucleus or the cytoplasm, the subcellular localization of endogenous Ran became apparently dominant in the cytoplasm of the ARAN1-injected cells, whereas control mouse IgG had no effect on  this distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> A for cytoplasmic injection and data  not shown for nuclear injection). The relocalization of Ran  was caused irrespective of the injection sites of ARAN1.  </p></sec><sec><title>ARAN1 Inhibits the Nuclear Import of Proteins  Containing the Classical NLS</title><p>Lastly, we examined the effect of ARAN1 on the nuclear  protein import in living cells. For this, ARAN1 or control  mouse IgG was injected into nucleus or cytoplasm before  the cytoplasmic injection of FITC-labeled BSA conjugated  with the NLS peptide of SV-40 T antigen (FITC&#x02013;T-BSA).  In both cases, in which ARAN1 was injected into the cytoplasm or the nucleus, the nuclear import of FITC&#x02013;T-BSA,  which was injected afterwards was clearly inhibited (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>  B for cytoplasmic injection and data not shown for nuclear  injection). In both cases, the injected ARAN1 was confirmed to be localized in the cytoplasm as expected from  the results of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (data not shown). In contrast, the simultaneous cytoplasmic injection of ARAN1 with FITC&#x02013; T-BSA failed to inhibit the nuclear import of the FITC&#x02013; T-BSA (data not shown). These results suggest that the  injected ARAN1 interrupts the Ran cycle in the cytoplasm  probably by preventing RanBP1 from interacting with the  Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex, which causes an abnormal distribution of Ran and further the suppression of nuclear  protein import.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>The COOH-terminal Acidic Domain of Ran Is Exposed  to the Molecular Surface as the Result of Its Interaction  with Importin &#x003b2; or Importin &#x003b2; Families</title><p>In this study we obtained a monoclonal anti-Ran antibody,  ARAN1, which recognizes mono-specific Ran as confirmed  by immunoblotting of total cell extract and immunofluorescent analysis of cultured cells. An epitope of ARAN1 was  found to lie in the acidic COOH-terminal domain of Ran. A  solution binding assay revealed that ARAN1 interacts only  with Ran, when it is complexed with importin &#x003b2;, transportin, or CAS&#x02013;importin &#x003b1; but not Ran alone. These results indicate that the COOH-terminal domain of Ran is exposed  to the molecular surface probably as the result of a conformational change only when importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport  factors bind to Ran. </p><p>Although ARAN1 recognizes only Ran complexed with  importin &#x003b2; or its related transport factors in solution, it  shows the same immunofluorescence pattern as a polyclonal anti-Ran antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since it was previously  reported that importin &#x003b2; is located not only in the cytoplasm but also within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kose et al., 1997</xref>), it is  likely that the apparent nucleoplasmic staining by ARAN1  means the complex formation of Ran with importin &#x003b2; and  importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors in the nucleus. Alternatively, this can be explained by a similar degree of Ran  denaturation during cell fixation as in immunoblotting. </p><p> It was found that ARAN1 binds to Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2; complex as well as Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex,  whereas it is known that importin &#x003b2; binds to Ran-GDP with  much lower affinity than to Ran-GTP. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chi et al. (1996)</xref>  demonstrated that the addition of RanBP1 with Ran-GDP  increased the affinity of Ran-GDP for importin &#x003b2;. By analogy, it is speculated that ARAN1 may stabilize the interaction of Ran-GDP with importin &#x003b2; like RanBP1. In both  cases, whereas ARAN 1 cannot reach the COOH-terminal  domain of Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP alone, the interaction of  Ran with importin &#x003b2; appears to induce a conformational  change of Ran so that ARAN1 is able to recognize the  epitope domain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al.

They therefore proposed  that the COOH-terminal domain is structurally flexible and  undergoes a nucleotide-dependent conformational change,  which is not inconsistent with the results herein.</p><p>Due to the characteristic amino acid sequences and conformational flexibility, it is likely that the COOH-terminal  domain has some functions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al. (1995)</xref> also  proposed from their biochemical analysis using &#x00394;DE-Ran  that the DEDDDL sequence stabilizes the GDP form of  Ran, possibly by folding into the guanine nucleotide binding  pocket and mimicking the negative charge on the &#x003b3;-phosphate of GTP. In addition, it was suggested that the COOH  terminus of Ran is implicated in the regulation of interaction between Ran and RanBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al., 1995</xref>).  Consistent with their suggestion, we showed that the binding of ARAN1 to the COOH-terminal tail suppresses the  interaction of RanBP1 with the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex.  Although &#x00394;DE-Ran is able to bind to RanBP1, its affinity  to RanBP1 is lower than wild-type Ran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Richards et al.,  1995</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that exposure of the COOH-terminal tail may increase the accessibility of RanBP1 not  only to the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex but also to the Ran&#x02013; importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factors. </p><p>A similar sequence in importin &#x003b2; (<sup>335</sup>DENDDDW<sup>342</sup>)  with the COOH-terminal domain of Ran is immediately  adjacent to sequences required for binding Ran-GDP/ RanBP1, but not Ran-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Chi et al., 1997</xref>). They proposed that this sequence in importin &#x003b2; substitutes for the  COOH-terminal Ran sequence in the nucleotide binding  pocket of Ran when GDP is bound and that this rearrangement would expose the COOH terminus of Ran for  binding to RanBP1, stabilizing the trimeric complex. Their  proposal is consistent with our result that the COOH-terminal tail of Ran-GDP was also exposed by the binding of  importin &#x003b2;. </p></sec><sec><title>The Export of Ran&#x02013;Importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related Transport  Factor Complexes from the Nucleus</title><p>Although it has been proposed that the Ran&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor complexes form in the nucleus,  are exported to the cytoplasm, and then dissociate in order  to recycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bischoff and G&#x000f6;rlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al.,  1997</xref>), this proposal has not been experimentally verified  in vivo. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al.

However, their results do not necessarily mean that the  Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor complexes are  translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a complex. Thus, in regard to the dynamic behavior of Ran  through the nuclear envelope, little concrete experimental  data exist. In this study, we found that a monoclonal anti-Ran antibody ARAN1 failed to inhibit the export of Ran  from the nucleus and inhibited reimport into the nucleus,  and that nuclearly injected ARAN1 was efficiently exported from the nucleus. Our results indicate that the  Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related transport factor complexes efficiently migrate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as a complex in living cells, even when complexed with ARAN1. Although it can not be excluded that the nuclear export of  ARAN1 injected into the nucleus could be due to complex  formation with Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related factors rather  than Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related factors, the current model  of a steep Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear membrane  (see introduction) and the immunoprecipitation experiments with ARAN1 in the presence of Q69L Ran-GTP  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> B) support that ARAN1 is exported from the nucleus as a complex with Ran-GTP and importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related  factors. </p></sec><sec><title>The Role of RanBP1 in the Recycling of Ran</title><p>After the translocation of the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex  into the cytoplasm, it is predicted that the complex is disassembled for the next round of nuclear import and the recycling of Ran. The Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex is kinetically very stable (the dissociation constant is &#x0223c;1 nM, when  nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis are blocked)  (G&#x000f6;rlich et al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Izaurralde et al., 1997</xref>). Injected  ARAN1 induced the relocalization of endogenous Ran in  living cells. That is, endogenous Ran was found predominantly in the cytoplasm within 30 min after injection (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Since the injected ARAN1 was also localized in the cytoplasm, irrespective of the injection site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), it is concluded that ARAN1 prevented the event(s) from occurring in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. Our in vitro  biochemical experiments (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) strongly suggest  that the injected ARAN1 efficiently interacts with the  Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex in the nucleus or the cytoplasm  and prevents the binding of RanBP1 to the Ran&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2; complex in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, it was found  that the COOH-terminal tail of Ran is also exposed via interaction with other importin &#x003b2; family molecules. Therefore, we conceive that Ran probably remains in the cytoplasm complexed with importin &#x003b2; or its related transport  factors due to the inhibition by ARAN1 on the binding of  RanBP1 to Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; or its related transport factor  complexes in the cytoplasm, although we did not examine  in this study that ARAN1 actually inhibits the binding of  RanBP1 to the complex of Ran with importin &#x003b2;&#x02013;related  transport factors other than importin &#x003b2;. At least part of  our conclusion is consistent with the recent biochemical  analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Bischoff and G&#x000f6;rlich (1997)</xref>. They showed that  the importin &#x003b1; and RanBP1 cooperatively relieved the  GAP resistance of the Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex, suggesting that RanBP1 is critical for the release of Ran-GTP  from importin &#x003b2;. Moreover, in our study, it was found that  ARAN1 competes much better for RanBP1 complexed to  Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; than to Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2;, which  means that RanBP1 has much higher affinity for Ran-GTP&#x02013; importin &#x003b2; complex than for Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex. This is consistent with the idea that RanBP1 efficiently  binds to Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex in the cytoplasm  to promote the dissociation of the complex.</p><p>RanBP2 contains four Ran-binding domains which are  functionally equivalent to RanBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Lounsbury et al.,  1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yokoyama et al., 1995</xref>). It is located at the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Wu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Yokoyama et al.,  1995</xref>) and a fraction of RanGAP which is modified by the  addition of a small ubiquitin-like peptide binds to RanBP2  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Matunis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Mahajan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Saitoh et al.,  1997</xref>). Therefore, RanBP2 may play the same role as  RanBP1 in the recycling of Ran, although further experiments will be required to better understand the role(s) of  RanBP2 on the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules as well as to understand the effect of ARAN1 on  RanBP2.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear Protein Import and Recycling of Ran and  Importin &#x003b2;</title><p>This study showed that ARAN1, when injected into cultured cells inhibits nuclear protein import mediated by basic-type classical NLS irrespective of the injection site, i.e.,  nucleoplasm or cytoplasm. It has been recently reported  that RanBP1 is required for nuclear protein import and  RNA export in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Schlenstedt et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Richards et al.,  1996</xref>) and stimulates the protein import in a permeabilized  cell-free assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chi et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, it has been  shown that the COOH terminus deleted Ran (&#x00394;DE-Ran)  represents the dominant-negative effect on the nuclear  protein import. In this study, we found that ARAN1 inhibits the interaction of RanBP1 (and probably RanBP2)  with the Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex. There are two possible  explanations for the inhibitory effect of ARAN1 on the  nuclear import of the classical NLS substrates. One possibility is that ARAN1 may inhibit the interaction of RanBP1 to  Ran-GTP&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex, which leads to the suppression of the disassembly of the complex. Alternatively,  consistent with the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Chi et al. (1996)</xref> that  RanBP1 promotes nuclear protein import by stabilizing the  interaction of Ran-GDP with importin &#x003b2;, ARAN1 may  block the function of RanBP1 on the interaction of Ran-GDP with importin &#x003b2; by binding to the Ran-GDP&#x02013;importin  &#x003b2; complex stably and, as a result, affect nuclear protein  import.</p><p>Thus, it seems most likely that the inhibition of the function of RanBP1 (and probably RanBP2) blocks the disassembly of Ran&#x02013;importin &#x003b2; complex in the cytoplasm,  which causes the depletion of nuclear Ran, an inhibition in  the recruitment of importin &#x003b2;, and further, the decline of  the recycling of importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to the cytoplasm by the suppression of the dissociation of the nuclear pore-targeting  complex (importin &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; bound to a karyophile) in the nucleus following the depletion of nuclear Ran. It appears  that such an imbalance in the import factors totally inhibits the nuclear protein import. Further studies will be necessary in order to understand whether ARAN1 also affects import and export pathways other than the classical  NLS import pathway.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Anti-Ran monoclonal antibody,  ARAN1, mono-specifically recognizes Ran  molecule.
