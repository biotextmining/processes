Development of disease can be prevented  by reconstitution of PVG rats shortly after their final irradiation with either peripheral  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T cells or CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from syngeneic donors. Although the activity of both populations is known to depend on the activities of endogenously produced interleukin 4 and transforming growth factor &#x003b2;, implying a common mechanism, the issue of antigen specificity of the cells involved has not yet been addressed. In this study, we show that the  regulatory T cells that prevent autoimmune thyroiditis are generated in vivo only when the  relevant autoantigen is also present. Peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, from rats whose thyroids were  ablated in utero by treatment with <sup>131</sup>I, were unable to prevent disease development upon  adoptive transfer into thymectomized and irradiated recipients. This regulatory deficit is specific for thyroid autoimmunity, since CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from <sup>131</sup>I-treated PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats were as  effective as those from normal donors at preventing diabetes in thymectomized and irradiated  PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats. Significantly, in contrast to the peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from <sup>131</sup>I-treated PVG donors were still able to prevent thyroiditis upon adoptive  transfer. Taken together, these data indicate that it is the peripheral autoantigen itself that stimulates the generation of the appropriate regulatory cells from thymic emigrant precursors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>autoantigen</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>There is compelling evidence that the immune system is  controlled by populations of T cells whose function is  to inhibit the activation of T cells that are potentially dangerous to the host. These regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) have  been described in the prevention of inflammatory responses  to dietary antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) and in the control of autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The mode of action of these protective cells is  not well understood, but a knowledge of their antigen specificity is an essential prerequisite for such understanding.</p><p>Studies of T<sub>reg</sub> in our own laboratory have exploited two  different inducible models of autoimmunity. Autoimmune  thyroiditis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)  are induced in PVG.RT1<sup>c</sup> (hereafter PVG) and PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup>  strain rats, respectively, by similar protocols of thymectomy  and split dose &#x003b3;-irradiation (TxX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Although both  diseases are similarly induced, they are characterized by  contrasting autoimmune processes. IDDM in PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup>  rats involves a CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell&#x02013;dependent cell-mediated  pathogenesis, whereas thyroiditis development in PVG rats  results in high titers of Th2-associated IgG1 isotype anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies and does not require CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T  cells. However, in both cases, development of disease can  be prevented by reconstitution of rats with either peripheral  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells or mature CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>),  and, at least in the prevention of thyroiditis, the suppressive  activity of both subsets is dependent on IL-4 and TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p>The T<sub>reg</sub> in the periphery that prevent autoimmunity are  found exclusively among cells with a resting memory phenotype (CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RC<sup>&#x02212;</sup>TCR-&#x003b1;&#x0002f;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>RT6<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Although  it has been shown that the thymus is a potent source of T<sub>reg</sub>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the observation that the peripheral cells have a  primed phenotype suggests that recognition of specific antigen in the periphery is an essential developmental step.  However, the identity of the antigen(s) is not known. Data  from studies of oophoritis and prostatitis that develop in  certain mice strains after thymectomy between 2 and 4 d  after birth implicate a role for tissue specific antigens in the  generation of T<sub>reg</sub>, since CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from mice lacking  the relevant organs, either due to gender or surgical removal, are less effective at preventing disease development  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). However, these data remain contentious since  other studies report contradictory results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and it is possible that gender-specific organs still share tissue-specific  antigens that may be the target of regulatory activity.</p><p>The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that the  encounter of T<sub>reg</sub> with peripheral self-antigen is essential  for their successful development. To address this question,  rats were generated in which the thyroid gland had been  completely ablated by treatment with <sup>131</sup>I in utero before  significant export of T cells from the thymus had occurred  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The data from this study show that T cells from these  athyroid rats were selectively unable to prevent thyroid-specific autoimmunity while retaining the capacity to prevent autoimmune diabetes. In contrast, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from the same athyroid donors were as effective as  those from normal rats at preventing thyroiditis. Implications for the development of T<sub>reg</sub> and the possibility for  therapeutic intervention in this process are discussed.</p><sec id="MaterialsMethods" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>mAbs.</title><p>The mouse mAbs used in these studies were as follows: OX6 (anti&#x02013;rat class II MHC; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), OX7 (anti&#x02013;rat  Thy-1; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), OX8 (anti&#x02013;rat CD8; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), and  OX12 (anti&#x02013;rat &#x003ba; chain; reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals and Induction of Thyroiditis and Diabetes.</title><p> 3&#x02013;12-wk-old  female PVG and PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats, which differ only in their  MHC haplotype, were obtained from the specific pathogen-free  breeding facilities of the Medical Research Council Cellular Immunology Unit (Oxford, UK).

Rats were  treated in utero with <sup>131</sup>I on day 18 of gestation by injecting the pregnant mother with 2 mCi of the isotope into the  peritoneal cavity. Serial sections of thyroid cartilage from  8-wk-old <sup>131</sup>I-treated rats revealed extensive destruction of  glands with little or no follicular thyroid tissue apparent  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> B). The success of the ablation was confirmed by  the detection of high levels of TSH in serum of treated animals. Thyroxine normally exerts negative feedback inhibition of TSH production via the hypothalamic-pituitary  axis, such that in the absence of thyroxine TSH levels are  allowed to increase unchecked. Serum TSH levels in PVG  or PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats treated with <sup>131</sup>I in utero were &#x0003e;10  times higher than those of normal rats (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TI">I</xref>).   </p><p>To determine whether thyroid antigen&#x02013;specific T<sub>reg</sub>  function had been affected by ablation of thyroid glands,  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from these rats were assayed for their ability  to regulate thyroid-specific autoimmunity by their adoptive  transfer into TxX PVG rats before development of thyroiditis. Although the protective capacity of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  has been shown previously to be mediated entirely by the  CD45RC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), unfractionated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  were assayed because, at least in principle, it was possible  that in the absence of specific thyroid antigen in <sup>131</sup>I-treated  rats, T<sub>reg</sub> would still be functional but assume a naive  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RC<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype. Autoimmune thyroiditis was  induced in PVG rats by their thymectomy at 3 wk of age  followed by four doses of 275 rad <sup>137</sup>Cs &#x003b3;-irradiation at 2 wk  intervals starting 1 wk after thymectomy. Groups of these  rats were reconstituted shortly after the final irradiation  with either 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes or 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  peripheral T cells purified from either normal or athyroid  8-wk-old PVG rats. Consistent with previous studies, a  highly significant proportion of rats reconstituted with  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes or CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from normal rats  were protected from development of both serological (Fig.  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A) and histological (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> D) signs of disease. In contrast,  TxX rats reconstituted with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from athyroid  rats developed high titers of anti-Tg antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> A)  and had extensive leukocytic infiltration of thyroid glands  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> F). Significantly, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from the  same athyroid rats were as effective as the same population  from normal rats at preventing development of thyroiditis  (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> E and 2 A).</p><p>One possible explanation for the failure of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  from athyroid rats to control thyroiditis was that the thyroxine deficiency that resulted from <sup>131</sup>I treatment may  have had an adverse effect on either thymopoiesis, and  therefore normal repertoire selection, or on peripheral T  cell function including that of T<sub>reg</sub>. Therefore, to test both  the specificity of the regulatory deficit and the impact of  thyroxine deficiency on T<sub>reg</sub> function, the ability of T cells  from athyroid rats to prevent autoimmunity was assayed in  a second autoimmune model not involving thyroid antigens. PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats were induced to develop insulin- dependent diabetes by a similar protocol of thymectomy  and split dose &#x003b3;-irradiation. Shortly after the final irradiation, rats were reconstituted with 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> peripheral T  cells from either normal or athyroid syngeneic donors. Significantly, the level of protection from diabetes afforded to  TxX PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats reconstituted with 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells  from athyroid syngeneic donors was almost identical to that  observed in recipients of 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from age-matched euthyroid controls. Approximately 50% of recipients were protected in both cases (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> C), a level of protection essentially the same as that observed in previous  studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Furthermore, that intrathymic generation of  T<sub>reg</sub> was not adversely affected by thyroxine deficiency in  <sup>131</sup>I-treated rats was evident from the observation that  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from these rats were able to prevent thyroiditis in TxX PVG rats.</p><p>The most economical interpretation of these data is that  peripheral autoantigen is itself responsible for the induction  of T<sub>reg</sub>, and although other interpretations are possible, T<sub>reg</sub>  appear to express TCRs specific for the relevant autoantigen. Athyroid rats were deficient only in T<sub>reg</sub> that control  thyroid targeted autoimmunity, since cells from these rats  could still suppress diabetes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, B and C). Such observations are compatible with others studies of thyroid autoimmunity that result after removal of thyroids during  gestation, either surgically or by <sup>131</sup>I ablation. Bilateral thyroidectomy but not hemithyroidectomy of lambs at 52 d of  gestation results in a loss of self-tolerance to the same thyroid glands, retransplanted after their storage in nude mice  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Similarly, rats exposed to <sup>131</sup>I in utero reject syngeneic  thyroid grafts as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, when thyroid- ablated rats are surgically parabiosed with normal, syngeneic partners, self-tolerance to thyroid transplantation is  restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). These results provide further evidence implicating a role for peripheral self-antigen in the generation of  specific T<sub>reg</sub>. Experiments with T<sub>reg</sub> in mice, which prevent  skin allograft rejection, are also compatible with this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>The observation of this study that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from athyroid rats retain the capacity to prevent  thyroiditis, in stark contrast to their peripheral counterparts, has implications regarding the lineage development  of these regulatory cells. Earlier studies demonstrated that  CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes are a more potent source of T<sub>reg</sub>  than are peripheral CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and that this is unlikely to be attributed to differences in their mechanism of  action, since protection from disease is dependent on IL-4  and TGF-&#x003b2; in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). One interpretation of these  data is that maturation of T<sub>reg</sub> from thymic emigrants into  the mature peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> population is subject to strict homeostatic regulation, such that only as many T<sub>reg</sub> undergo  peripheral maturation as are required to suppress the activity of autoreactive T cells in the repertoire. Under conditions where the T<sub>reg</sub> pool has been perturbed, as occurs  during the induction of autoimmunity in TxX rats, such a  mechanism would stimulate the differentiation of all potential precursors among CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes. Since mature peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> have already undergone differentiation,  no further recruitment is possible, and it is this difference in  plasticity of the regulatory populations that results in the  apparent potency of thymocytes compared with peripheral  cells. That CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes from athyroid rats are  able to prevent disease development shows that intrathymic  generation of T<sub>reg</sub> during repertoire selection does not require peripheral thyroid tissue. Thymocytes from these animals have the potential to mature into specific T<sub>reg</sub>, but in  the absence of peripheral antigen fail to do so. However,  adoptive transfer of these cells into euthyroid TxX rats rescues T<sub>reg</sub> development and in doing so protects the recipients from disease development. These data suggest that the  requirement for self-antigen in T<sub>reg</sub> maturation is also the  point of homeostatic control, raising the possibility that it is  the T<sub>reg</sub> themselves that regulate their own differentiation.  With regard to the fate of the T<sub>reg</sub> precursor that emerges  from the thymus of athyroid rats in the absence of autoantigen, it is not possible to conclude whether the regulatory  deficit in these rats results from a failure of these cells to expand to a functionally significant frequency or a failure of  the cells to survive in the absence of autoantigen.</p><p>The finding that the thymus is a potent source of T<sub>reg</sub>  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), together with the observation that mRNA for many &#x0201c;tissue-specific&#x0201d; autoantigens, including insulin and thyroglobulin, can be detected intrathymically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) is suggestive  of a role for positive selection of the T cell repertoire on  self-antigens in the generation of T<sub>reg</sub>. There is some evidence that the self-antigens that mediate positive selection  are antagonist peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Significantly, recognition  of synthetic antagonistic peptide has been shown in several  studies to affect cytokine production, notably that of TGF-&#x003b2;  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This raises the possibility that peripheral T cell recognition of the autoantigen on which they were selected intrathymically induces generation of T<sub>reg</sub> and evokes a regulatory response from them that acts to specifically suppress  autoimmune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Finally, previous studies suggest that there exists in the T  cell repertoire a fine balance between autoreactive T cells  and the T<sub>reg</sub> that control them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, any adverse perturbation of this balance, either congenital or environmental, could result in autoimmunity. The conclusion of this  study, that peripheral autoantigen is responsible for the induction of specific T<sub>reg</sub> from precursors found in abundance amongst mature thymocytes, raises the possibility of  augmenting the physiological process with a therapeutic  outcome. In principle, administration of autoantigens in an  appropriate form may have the effect of increasing the induction of T<sub>reg</sub> and as such represent a basis for vaccination  against autoimmune disease.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Morphology of thyroid glands in <sup>131</sup>I-treated rats and TxX  rats with thyroiditis.

Further groups of TxX PVG rats were reconstituted with 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>  T cells purified from the same normal and athyroid PVG donors. Development of anti-Tg IgG responses was monitored for between 4 and 12  wk after the last irradiation by specific ELISA. Data represent peak anti-Tg IgG titers of individual TxX rats, expressed as percentage of standard  (A). TxX PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats were reconstituted shortly after their final irradiation with 10<sup>7</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells purified from either normal or athyroid  8-wk-old PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats. The disease incidence of thyroiditis in groups  of TxX PVG rats (B) and diabetes in groups of TxX PVG.RT1<sup>u</sup> rats (C)  reconstituted with different cell subsets from different donors are expressed as a percentage of the group. Numbers in parentheses show the  actual incidence and group sizes. <italic>P</italic> values were calculated using Fisher's  exact test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEM982127.f2"/></fig></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Powrie</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlino</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Leach</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Mauze</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Coffman</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A critical role for transforming growth factor  &#x003b2;
