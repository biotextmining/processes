No one anticipated their  existence; therefore, they must be telling us something  we did not know. Also appealing are the esthetics of a  sharp rise in local Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, extremely limited in space and  time but large compared with the recording noise.</p><p>These features encouraged from early on a parsimonious interpretation of their origin and significance, including two related aspects: sparks are the result of ryanodine receptor channels (RyRs) opening individually and they are the sole form of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (all  release is constituted by sparks). An alternative view  gained credence later, that sparks involve several (say,  20) channels opening and closing in concert. This view  was fostered by observations of a release that is continuous, or constituted by events smaller than sparks, presumably reflecting the opening of individual channels.  Therefore, the two views disagree as regards both the  number of channels involved and existence and relevance of a nonspark form of release.</p><p>Even though the contrast between these two views attracts much of the attention, the most significant question that has to be answered, as a way of furthering our  understanding of physiologic control of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release,  contemplates the mechanisms by which sparks or other  forms of release are elicited. A first answer, almost trivial  for lack of alternatives in the case of cardiac muscle, is  that sparks are elicited by a local increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), brought about initially by the opening of membrane L-type Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels.</p><p>In the case of skeletal muscle, where physiologic release requires first the activation of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPr's) operating as membrane voltage sensors, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> appears to be the physiologic trigger of sparks  as well. The evidence includes morphological similarity  of sparks in both types of muscle, the observed correlation between spark frequency and myoplasmic [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Klein et al., 1996</xref>), and the effects of antagonists of  CICR (tetracaine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>; and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>,  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The detection of sparks was made possible by confocal microscopy and the existence of indicators that fluoresce negligibly when free of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and have kinetic reaction constants that allow them to report effectively  even brief events of localized release. If fluo-3 is allowed time to equilibrate, the signal &#x00394;<italic>F</italic> that it produces  relative to the initial level of fluorescence <italic>F</italic><sub>0 </sub>is proportional to the increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] relative to the initial,  resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This proportionality extends, with scant  saturation within a wide range of release fluxes, to the  relationship between &#x00394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> and the flux of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release  during a simulated spark. This is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> where  sparks are simulated as the result of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> flux from a  channel undergoing one 6-ms opening in a homogeneous medium with distributed Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> removal properties that copy those of myoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">R&#x000ed;os et al.,  1998</xref>; and R&#x000ed;os, Stern, Gonz&#x000e1;lez, Pizarro, and Shirokova, manuscript submitted for publication). Another  feature of this type of simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Pratusevich and  Balke, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>) is a  close relationship between the release duration and the  rise time of the simulated spark. </p><p>The issue of the number of channels involved in a  spark has been approached by measuring morphological aspects of individual sparks (how &#x0201c;tall&#x0201d; and wide  they are, and how long they last), by trying to guess how  much Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release flux would be necessary to reproduce such events, by interfering with CICR, and by  quantitative modeling. These studies help evaluate the  significance of sparks within the framework of excitation&#x02013;contraction (E-C) coupling. This article reviews  them in six brief sections. </p><sec disp-level="2"><title>How Big Is a Spark?</title><p>Measured spark amplitude varies widely from the lower  limits of detection (defined by noise, usually &#x0223c;0.3 U <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>)  to the highest values recorded, which in our experience with cut fiber segments under voltage clamp go  routinely beyond 6 <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> for a few sparks in every experiment. Current work with cardiac myocytes and smooth  muscle also finds events of amplitude &#x0003e;5, much larger  than in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Wier et al., 1999</xref>). In our experience amplitudes are substantially lower in fibers permeabilized by saponin or by notches and immersed in  internal solution (a preparation described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lacampagne et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The reason for the differences in amplitude may be  quite simple: as stated, &#x00394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> is close to the ratio between increase in local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] and resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The  cell may be able to maintain a substantially lower internal Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the voltage clamp experiments, which expose it to internal solution at the cut ends only. By contrast, in permeabilized fiber segments, free [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]  should equilibrate rapidly within the cell at the solution value, and the dye rises rapidly, reaching values  higher than the concentration in the internal solution.  Therefore, the relative increase &#x00394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> (or &#x00394;[Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]/ resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]) should be less in the permeabilized fibers due to the buffering effect of the higher [dye]  (which reduces &#x00394;[Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]) and the higher resting [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>].  Indeed, sparks with very large values of &#x00394;<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> are only  found early in voltage clamp experiments, when the  resting fluorescence is very low (indicating low dye concentration, low [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], or both).</p><p>In our first study of discrete events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Tsugorka et al.,  1995</xref>), we evaluated event amplitude by constructing  all-points histograms of the difference records between  fluorescence at triadic centers and in the neighboring  sarcomeres. The resulting histograms had modes at between 0.1 and 0.3 <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, which were interpreted as spark  amplitudes. We now believe that the all-points histogram is not an adequate tool to recognize sparks because it does not take into account their multidimensional aspects. When their frequency is low, sparks will  contribute negligibly to the all-points histogram, which  should be dominated by very small fluctuations that  may correspond to out-of-focus sparks or to continuous, eventless release. In fact, when automatic procedures are used with an amplitude selection criterion  (see next section), the resulting histograms also peak at  or near the lowest allowed amplitude. Therefore,  modes in the amplitude distributions will always be at  very small values regardless of the true amplitude of the  events. We now prefer methods of recognition by multidimensional criteria (amplitude, width, duration).  Such recognition was initially done by an observer  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Klein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and  R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>), but is now entirely automatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cheng et al.,  1999</xref>), and yields amplitude estimates at least an order  of magnitude greater.</p><p>The width of large sparks (measured as full width at  half magnitude, FWHM) varies between 1.5 and 2.2 &#x003bc;m  in skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, where some  sparks appear to result from multiple release sources  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Parker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Blatter et al., 1997</xref>) and can be very  wide, there is a well defined subset of sparks that appear to originate from single release sites. The half  width of those is similar to that in skeletal muscle, &#x0223c;2 &#x003bc;m.  Surprisingly, and as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, in simulations of  sparks resulting from a discrete Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> source the half  width is only &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;m, regardless of assumptions on the  properties of buffers and the dye. The width of the simulated spark could be increased to reach values near 2 &#x003bc;m  by increasing the radius of the source (to 1 &#x003bc;m). The  discrepancy and its resolution may be taken as evidence  that the source of release is extensive (rather than a single channel), or it may mean that the models of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  release and removal are inadequate in ways we do not  understand.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> Release Flux Underlying a Spark</title><p>This has been calculated in cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Blatter et al., 1997</xref>;  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Lukyanenko et al., 1998</xref>) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">R&#x000ed;os et al.,  1998</xref>; manuscript submitted for publication) by generalizing global or whole-cell procedures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Baylor et al.  (1983)</xref> and Melzer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">1987</xref>) to the spatially resolved images obtained by confocal microscopy. The  earlier procedures first derive from the optical signals  the transient increase in free [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], and then calculate the increase in total calcium necessary to account  for such transient by adding contributions from different Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding and removal processes. They are  therefore subject to errors in the calculation of free  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] and in the ulterior estimate of binding and removal. The generalization to sparks has additional uncertainties regarding diffusional mobility of the different  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ligands and placement of fixed sites. If calculations  are carried out assuming a homogeneous and unrestricted distribution of sites, with consensus values for  concentrations, diffusion coefficients, and reaction rate  constants, the values obtained are typically near 10 pA,  and often &#x0003e;20 pA for the largest sparks in every image.</p><p>A lower bound of released Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can be obtained  without calculating local [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], based on the rate of  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> binding to the dye that is needed to account for  the observed fluorescence. Take as numeric example a  permeabilized fiber equilibrated with a 100 nM free  [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>], 200 &#x003bc;M fluo-3 solution, at a time when the internal dye concentration has risen to 300 &#x003bc;M. In this  condition, the resting fluorescence corresponds to &#x0223c;30  &#x003bc;M of the dye:Ca complex (assuming that the dye reacts inside the fiber with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 1 &#x003bc;M, the low end of  the range estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Harkins et al., 1993</xref>). A large  spark under these conditions may have an amplitude of  2.5 <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, requiring an additional 75 &#x003bc;M of dye-bound  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. The quantity of dye-bound Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can be found by  volume integration of concentration, roughly the product of peak value by the volume of the sphere that intersects the spark at half magnitude, say 1.8 &#x003bc;m. Thus,  75 &#x003bc;M &#x000d7; 3.05 &#x003bc;m<sup>3</sup> or 0.23 amol Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, equivalent to  43.4 fC, must be released within the rise time of the  spark, 5 ms. Therefore, an average current close to 10  pA must flow for 5 ms just to account for the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> bound  to the dye in this example. Such values are typical of  large sparks in experiments with permeabilized fibers.</p><p>The free [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] in cardiac SR was estimated using <sup>19</sup>F  NMR at 1.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Chen et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Mej&#x000ed;a-Alvarez et al.  (1999)</xref> used the result to estimate the physiologic current-carrying capability of cardiac release channels,  measuring their Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> current in bilayers, with a luminal  side [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] of 2 mM and in the presence of concentrations of Cs<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> comparable to physiologic [K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>]. Under  those conditions, the average unitary current was 0.35  pA. Extrapolated to the case of skeletal muscle, this estimate indicates that tens of channels should be open  to account for large sparks.</p><p>Though lower than in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Tinker et al.,  1992</xref>), these estimates of current per channel are consistent with whole-cell measures of release flux. The  maximum flux density (expressed as rate of rise of total  calcium concentration in the accessible myoplasmic  volume) under voltage clamp in the frog is between  180 and 200 mM/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Pape et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Shirokova and  R&#x000ed;os, 1996</xref>). The volume density of release channels  can be gathered from morphometry. The ratio of transverse tubule length to fiber volume is 0.82 &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> in frog  muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Eisenberg and Peachey, 1975</xref>). If 70% of this  length is junctional and contains a double row of release channels at 30 nm spacing on each side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Block et  al., 1988</xref>), the number of channels per liter is 0.82  &#x003bc;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> (tubule length/fiber volume) &#x000d7; 0.7 (triad  length/tubule length), &#x000d7; 2 (junctions/triad), &#x000d7; 2  (rows/junction), &#x000d7; 33 (channels/row/&#x003bc;m), or 1.08 &#x000d7;  10<sup>17</sup> channels per liter of fiber. At 100% activation,  such channels passing 0.35 pA would generate a flux  density of 180 mmol/liter of fiber per s, or 260 mM/s in  terms of accessible aqueous myoplasmic volume, surpassing the highest whole-cell estimates.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The Distribution of Spark Amplitudes</title><p>The appeal of sparkology, as we stated, is to some extent esthetic&#x02014;images with sparse sparks, in a dark experimental room, look very much like a starry sky.  Much as stars in the sky, small sparks greatly outnumber the large ones, and the reasons for this are not very  different for sparks and stars. Indeed, sparks are recorded in line scans, but may originate anywhere  within the junctions of a Z disk. The smoothly decaying  point spread function of the imaging system implies  that the sparks originating farther from the scanned  line will appear smaller in the record. And the regions  of Z disk that lie &#x0201c;far&#x0201d; are greater than those that are  &#x0201c;near,&#x0201d; hence the probability density function of spark  amplitudes is expected to be decaying, even if sparks as  objects are all of the same size.</p><p>The above reasoning led two groups to derive, using  different formal approaches, the distribution of amplitudes expected in a line scan image for identical sparks  that originate with homogeneous probability in triadic  locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Izu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>). This  function is a simple inverse proportionality (pdf &#x0221d; <italic>a</italic><sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,  where <italic>a</italic> is recorded amplitude).</p><p>In agreement with theory, the amplitude histograms  of events identified by a program that locates them  without human intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cheng et al., 1999</xref>) are  monotonically decreasing. The dependence of frequency on amplitude, however, is not the inverse function predicted for identical sparks, being consistent instead with a widely spread distribution of real spark amplitudes. The distribution of real spark amplitudes  (derived by a method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al., 1999</xref>, which  corrects for the effect of line scanning) exhibits in the  presence of caffeine a mode or preferred amplitude at  between 2 and 3 <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p><p>With this improved understanding of the meaning of  recorded spark amplitude, it is natural to use large  sparks, rather than those of average size, to estimate release flux, because the large ones are more likely originated near the scanned line, where recorded amplitudes are greatest. Because there is a spread of actual  amplitudes, the largest sparks, whose underlying release current was estimated at &#x0003e;20 pA, may be outliers  of unusually large amplitude as objects. For the sparks  of the most common size, one third of the above estimate should apply, or &#x0223c;7 pA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Beyond Sparks</title><p>The above considerations, plus the structural evidence  that release channels are clustered in closely packed arrays, in skeletal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Block et al., 1988</xref>) as well as cardiac  muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Sun et al., 1995</xref>), present a problem if single  channels gate individually to produce sparks. How can  a release channel pass the spark current (somewhere  between 1 and 30 pA) without activating other channels that face the same junctional gap, where [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]  would rapidly rise beyond 100 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Langer and Peskoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stern et al., 1997</xref>)? The argument was bolstered by the demonstration in cardiac muscle of coupled fluorescence events in scans perpendicular to the  fiber axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Parker et al., 1996</xref>) and of multiple sources  of release under large sparks of cat atria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Blatter et al.,  1997</xref>). Both observations show that the activation of  cardiac release channels, presumably by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, occasionally reaches across distances of 1 &#x003bc;m or more, stressing  that single Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-activatable channels within a junction  can hardly operate independently.</p><p>A many-channel origin for sparks was supported by  the observation in ventricular myocytes of a diffuse increase in fluorescence, devoid of sparks, when trigger  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was delivered by photolysis of DM-nitrophen  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lipp and Niggli, 1996</xref>). The authors hypothesized that  thus triggered SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release was composed by contributions (termed quarks) that could not be individually  detected. Although the terminology is intriguing, skeletal muscle soon forced consideration of another alternative, continuous release.</p><p>In skeletal muscle, an increase in fluorescence not  composed of sparks can be readily demonstrated under  a number of conditions. When slightly depolarized,  some frog fibers show at triads release not constituted  by discrete events, while typical sparks appear at higher  voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>). In tetracaine at  200 &#x003bc;M, which blocks release channels in bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Xu  et al., 1993</xref>), depolarization triggers continuous release  but no sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian muscle of adult rats, voltage-clamp depolarization caused continuous Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release and contraction, but no sparks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shirokova et al., 1998</xref>). The triadic origin of the release was demonstrated by the existence of a triadic gradient of fluorescence (which is  nearly proportional to release flux; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Tsugorka et al.,  1995</xref>). Because the gradients of fluorescence associated  with continuous release in both frogs and rats could be  much lower than in sparks, it appears that continuous  release may involve smaller currents, again indicating  the participation of channel groups in the production  of sparks.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os (1997)</xref> interpreted the continuous release observed in frogs at very low voltages or in  the presence of tetracaine as flux through channels directly operated by voltage sensors. They proposed that  sparks are the consequence of opening of multiple  channels, caused by a local increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]. This increase would be started in frog skeletal muscle by release channels operated by voltage-sensing DHPrs, and  reinforced by the opening of additional channels. The  directly voltage-operated release component could appear alone, without triggering CICR and sparks, if the  concentration of trigger Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was insufficient (e.g., at  low voltage depolarization) or the sensitivity to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was  inhibited (in the tetracaine experiment). This hypothesis also explains why it is so difficult to demonstrate nonspark release in cardiac muscle, where presumably there  is no direct activation of release by voltage.</p><p>Rat muscle provides an example of eventless release  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shirokova et al., 1998</xref>) that is most interesting for various reasons. The failure to observe sparks there could  simply evidence difficulties in working with smaller,  weaker cells, cut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hollingworth et al., 1996</xref>), and at far  from physiologic temperature. We believe instead that  the absence of sparks in adult rats reflects a fundamental difference in the E-C coupling mechanism, consistent with differences found in whole cell experiments  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Shirokova et al., 1996</xref>). These differences include a  lesser peak of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release flux, a lower ratio between  the peak and steady levels of release under voltage  clamp, the absence in the rat of the characteristic voltage dependence of this ratio observed in the frog, and  the presence in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Suda and Penner, 1994</xref>), but  not in the frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1996</xref>), of the RISC  phenomenon, a stop by repolarization of the release induced by caffeine.</p><p>RISC is interpreted as indicating a preponderance of  control by membrane voltage (via the DHPr). Its presence in the rat, and failure to appear in the frog, are  consistent with our failure to demonstrate sparks  (which presumably are mediated by CICR) in rats, and  the ease with which continuous, voltage-operated release can be demonstrated in the mammal. In all, it appears that CICR is fundamental in the frog, where it determines sparks and the pronounced, steeply voltage-dependent peak of the release waveform, while it is  much less important, perhaps absent, in the rat. Because sparks were present in myotubes from embryonic  or neonatal mice, which unlike adult cells express RyR  isoform 3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Shirokova et al. (1998)</xref> proposed that the  production of sparks could require RyR3 (or the corresponding &#x003b2; isoform in frog muscle). This possibility is  now bolstered by the observation of sparks in dyspedic  mouse cells expressing RyR3 but not RyR1 (see  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Schneider, 1999</xref>, in this issue).</p><p>Finally, the molecular makeup of frog triads is usually  assumed to be the same as that in mammals, but this  may not be the case. The ratio of ryanodine-binding  sites to DHPrs expected from the structural model of  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Block et al. (1988)</xref>, in which four voltage sensors face  every other release channel, is 0.5. This value is found  approximately in membrane fractions of rabbit or human muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bers and Stiffel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Margreth et al.,  1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>). In frogs, the value is &#x0223c;1.5  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Margreth et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>), which  would suggest an excess of release channels, either outside the double row or violating the pattern in some  other way. The possibility of major structural differences must be kept in mind, as the morphological  alignment of mammalian and fish junctions has never  been confirmed in the frog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Franzini-Armstrong and  Jorgensen, 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Models of Spark Generation</title><p>The &#x0201c;couplon&#x0201d; model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stern et al., 1997</xref>) is the latest of  a class that assumes interactions within arrays of channels. The couplon, consisting of the contiguous array  of RyRs associated with one side of a junctional segment of transverse tubule, includes two rows of RyRs  that alternate between those associated with a DHPr  tetrad, presumed to be controlled only by voltage (V  channels), and those lacking contact with DHPrs,  which are assumed to be activated and inactivated by  Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> alone (C channels). With suitable parameters, this  model reproduces many of the global features of frog  skeletal muscle E-C coupling (including its &#x0201c;quantal&#x0201d;  aspects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Pizarro et al., 1997</xref>), which would be difficult to  explain if release resulted from channels gating independently.</p><p>The couplon model normally generates spark-like release packets. Openings of V channels trigger, by CICR,  openings of adjacent C channels, which in turn may recruit other C channels. The whole couplon, or a part of  it, may thus activate to generate a phenomenon similar  to a spark. Given the assumed C channel unitary current, 0.3 pA, and the size of a couplon (10&#x02013;30 C channels), the simulated spark sizes are consistent with the  observations. Most interestingly, the couplon sparks  have a preferred amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Stern et al., 1997</xref>), in  agreement with amplitude distributions obtained by  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Gonz&#x000e1;lez et al. (1999)</xref> in the presence of caffeine.</p><p>Could single channel openings produce sparks with a  preferred amplitude? As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the amplitude  of a spark due to a single channel opening should be  nearly proportional to the opening duration. For a single Markovian channel, gating reversibly, the distribution of open times is a sum of positively weighted decaying exponentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1995</xref>), so a  mode in the distribution of amplitudes would not be  expected. However, RyRs of striated muscle can be activated by its own permeating Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> under suitable conditions in lipid bilayers (Tripathy and Meissner, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Xu  and Meissner, 1998</xref>). This would couple the free energy of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> permeating down its electrochemical gradient to the gating process, permitting irreversible gating kinetics and open time distributions with a mode  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The couplon simulations reproduce the sharp peak  observed in whole-cell determinations of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release  in the frog as essentially a sum of sparks, while the  steady level that follows the peak is accounted for as a  combination of sparks and continuous, directly voltage-operated release. This picture of the peak of release as  composed of sparks and mediated by CICR justifies  that tetracaine eliminates sparks together with the peak  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os, 1997</xref>), and that the peak can be  reconstructed by superposition of sparks whose timing  is determined in fibers with partially inactivated voltage  sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Klein et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The couplon, and related multichannel models, explain the increase of the peak relative to the steady  level as voltage is increased, as a result of cooperation  of multiple voltage-operated sources within the same  couplon to produce a level of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> that will elicit  sparks. Such models predict that partial inactivation of  voltage sensors or interference with CICR may be compensated by recruiting more voltage sensors, hence explaining that DHPr antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Shirokova and R&#x000ed;os,  1997</xref>), high intracellular Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Kirsch et al., 1999</xref>), or  BAPTA (Brum and Pizarro, 1998), inhibit sparks or the  peak phase of release at low, but not at high voltages.</p><p>The most parsimonious model (release entirely composed of sparks reflecting opening of one or two channels operated by one voltage sensor) is ruled out by its  prediction that disabling some voltage sensors would  just scale down release and spark numbers. Instead, the  waveform reconstructed in partially inactivated fibers  (Klein et al.<italic>,</italic> 1997) showed a much smaller steady component of release flux at high voltage than in fully  primed fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Pape et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Shirokova et al., 1996</xref>),  which again suggests the existence of a voltage-operated release not in discrete events, and required higher  voltages to produce a peak of release (compared with  fully primed fibers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Klein et al., 1996</xref>), which again indicates cooperation among multiple voltage sensors to  activate the same release unit.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Terminating the Spark</title><p>As we stated at the outset, sparks were not expected.  Their spatial discreteness could have been predicted  on structural grounds (in fact, spatially segregated release at triads had been demonstrated earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Escobar et al., 1994</xref>), but their temporal brevity was startling. Rise times of sparks, which roughly measure release duration, are quite independent of triggering  voltage, partial inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Klein et al., 1997</xref>), or Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">L&#x000f3;pez-L&#x000f3;pez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Santana et al.,  1996</xref>), which suggests a termination mechanism intrinsic to the release unit, rather than the trigger.</p><p>The models of spark generation described above underscore the difficulties in devising a mechanism with  robust termination. Local depletion of SR Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> has  been ruled out in cardiac myocytes because Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks  may last up to a few seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Parker  and Wier, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Xiao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Lukyanenko et al.,  1998</xref>). In skeletal and cardiac muscle, images of sparks  arising repetitively from the same unit also indicate  that depletion does not determine spark termination.  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Sham et al. (1998)</xref> examined the issue in cardiac myocytes, where sparks are triggered by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx  through membrane channels. Observing that reopenings of membrane Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, even with duration  greatly prolonged by FPL64176, failed to trigger Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>  release, they concluded that the termination mechanism includes desensitization to the trigger. Furthermore, they showed that this loss of sensitivity is not an  adaptation (in the sense proposed by Gy&#x000f6;rke and Fill,  1993, whereby channels that lose sensitivity can be reactivated by higher [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]) because Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release activated by the tail membrane current at the end of a  pulse involved only channels that were not activated at  the beginning of the pulse. Taken together, these results indicate that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> sparks are terminated primarily  by inactivation of RyRs. It remains to be established  whether the inactivation is a Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent process  (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Fabiato, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Schneider and Simon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Jong et al.,  1995</xref>), or is &#x0201c;fatal&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Pizarro et al., 1997</xref>), an obligatory  coda to channel opening.</p><p>In any case, the implementation of such mechanisms is  more difficult if sparks are multichannel events, simply  because it is more difficult to turn-off many channels synchronously. Inter-channel allosteric interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Marx et  al., 1998</xref>) might help, channel closing could be synchronized by negative interactions between RyRs in the quasi-crystal of the junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Stern et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In summary, sparks appear to constitute the totality  of physiologic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release in cardiac muscle, and a major portion of it in frog skeletal muscle. The early peak  of release during a voltage pulse is largely constituted  by a superposition of sparks, a conclusion that can  probably be extrapolated to release in response to an  action potential. Release not constituted by separable  events is found under various conditions in skeletal  muscle; it might be the trigger of sparks in frogs, and  the sole form of release in mammals. The origin of  sparks is unsettled. The release flux estimated for the  largest sparks seems too high to be carried by just one  channel. The shift of voltage dependence of spark activation upon partial inactivation of voltage sensors and  other complex properties of the whole-cell release  waveform are better understood if channels engage in  group interactions. Finally, if sparks were one-channel  events, it would be difficult to explain why most release  channels would consistently fail to activate when facing  the high triadic gap [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>] associated with a typical  spark. On the other hand, the rapid and effective termination of individual sparks can be more easily justified if sparks result from the opening of individual release channels. The distribution of spark amplitudes  corrected for the distorting effects of line scanning may  exhibit a modal amplitude, which is more easily explained with multichannel models of sparks, but may  also be a feature of single channels that gate irreversibly. In general, it is very difficult to account for the  properties of sparks, or whole-cell Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, by simply extrapolating the properties of individual channels  in bilayers, which suggests that interactions with other  triadic proteins, including release channels, and other  forms of local modulation, may crucially influence  physiologic gating.</p><p>Many questions therefore remain unanswered. Going  back to the stars metaphor, the trek is far from over.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simulations of sparks for three Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> currents represented at top, of 2, 5, and 25 pA, lasting 6 ms, originating at even  density from a 0.2-&#x003bc;m radius sphere and entering a homogeneous  medium with distributed Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> removal properties that simulate  skeletal muscle.
